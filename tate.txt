​ all of the ideologies which are being pushed by The Matrix are designed to destroy something Andrew Tate goes on a
massive attack to the crypto Community yeah I'm a Bitcoin maximalist that's you
that's your personality that's everything you are he shares a story he's never told in a secret he's never
shed I know a killer when I see one me and him of a Mexican standoff in the back of the car they set me up when I
put my bag in the trunk at the beginning he explains to you step by step how you can get rich and he exposes feminism and
defends himself against misogyny feminism is probably the most misogynistic movement on Earth because what it does is it makes women into
competitors with men in Realms where they can't compete with men before I tell you the wild discussions we had I'm
giving away £30,000 worth of exclusive prizes just for listening to both parts
of this Andrew Tate launch all you have to do is find the secret question hidden
in these two episodes what defines sexual consent
bro you saiding bring it you told me to bring it well it's forever changing
isn't it I think if we're watching this I think everyone at home knows what rape is I think everyone at home knows what
an actual rape is and how heinous and disgusting that is and I'm the first person as a masculine man to say that
rapist should face the death penalty I'll say it myself a woman regretting consensual sex years later is not rape I
think that's cheapening the idea of rape I think it's insulting to the women who have genuinely been raped I think to sit
and say that rape can now include a woman having a one night stand demanding
handbags not getting handbags being upset that she can't get handbags still not calling the police seeing that man
bu another woman a handbag a year and a half later and then deciding it was rape I think that is extremely insulting to
the unfortunate women who have suffered genuine sex crime I think it's disgusting I also think that most women
and most men know what sexual consent is I have daughters I have a lot of
daughters and sons but I want to make something clear because one of the things that's used
against me most often is people say I said women bear some responsibility for getting raped which is not what I said
what I said is that we're adults and we must all bear responsibility for the situations we find ourselves in if a
woman is walking her dog in the park and is raped that's disgusting and that's not her fault what I was talking about
was a particular scenario in which a woman will go out with a man get drunk with a man spend all night with a man go
to the man's house continue to drink have sex with the man then years later
decide that it was rape my argument would be if you don't want to have sex with a man do not get drunk with him and do not go lay in his bed that's my
argument I have daughters and I would say do not get drunk with men and lay in their bed if you don't want to have sex with them ever don't do that because
you're going to give the man the impression now I'm not saying the man can rape her I'm not saying that I'm saying that you're putting yourself in a
position where rape is more likely to happen if I decide to walk through the worst area of town with a million
dollars in cash yeah nobody should rob me you're right it's a crime to rob me but am I
making myself a robbery Target am I making myself easy to rob it would be irresponsible for me to do such a thing
so I think that the best way to protect women in these scenarios is not to do
what the feminists are doing which is to come along and try and create this Ideal World well men should know not to rape
we do we know not to rape we also know not to kill and women should know not to
lie but guess what people are imperfect and people do bad things so what you have to do is take personal
responsibility and protect yourself against the possibility of these things I think that the reason sexual
consent has now become such a Hot Topic is yes there's Bad actors doing bad
things of course men and women but truthfully I think a lot all of this is happening because we've removed some of
the basic societal Norms a woman wouldn't get drunk with a man and go to a man's house and lay in the man's bed
and kiss the man and take all her clothes off and then not want to sleep with a man 40 years ago so the consent
line wasn't as blurred because it was you're not my husband or you're not my boyfriend I don't want to go anywhere
near you it was pretty clear line so then the line had to be jumped over by a predator but now the line's all messy
because of the immorality of people male and female so now it's very difficult where do you draw the line what if she
gives consent but she was drunk that doesn't count how is the man supposed to know is he supposed to get out a blood
alcohol measure and and make her BB oh sorry your yes doesn't
count the whole Line's messed up because morality is destroyed if you destroy morality then now there can't be a line
so I can't answer the question nobody can and the law is coming along trying to find the line in all these individual
cases in these huge court cases trying to find the line where there's no morality at all I would
argue and I know this is difficult to say but I'm going to say it if my daughter came to me and said I was
raped before on my way to get my gun I'd say tell me the story and if she said I
met a man and I was dating him for many weeks and I went out with him and I started drinking with him and then I went to his house and we continued to
drink and it was a party and then we started kissing I took all my clothes off and then we started having sex and then uh and then I decided I didn't want
to have sex anymore I'm like I can't truthfully shoot this man in the head anymore why did you do all of that why
didn't you just say no and I'm talking about my own daughter here I but I don't know if I'm allowed
to say this without the world having a mental breakdown because we live in a world now where nothing is nuanced you can't make a nuanced point you can't
talk about how complicated a subject is everyone wants black and white it's
difficult what sexual consent is anymore because when you remove morality there's no longer a line I don't know it's hard this is why
I've settled down with my 11 wives because you you can't trust anyone let's imagine I meet a brand new girl and
let's imagine we have a happy relationship un let's imagine we're together for nine months and let's imagine we have sex 100 times and let's
imagine I don't buy her a
BMW let's imagine and let's imagine she texts me
and says I want a BMW and I say no and let's imagine she texts me and says if
you don't buy me a BMW I will go to the police and say you raped me so imagine
she admits wish she from Peterboro where I live well let's imagine she admits via
text to the crime she admits what she's going to do for a car and I still refuse
to buy her a car when she goes to the police and makes that complaint I will still be arrested I will still be
demonized in the media I will still have to go to court I will still have to go through a trial I will still spend $3
million in legal fees despite her admitting to the fact she is lying for a
car I will still have my reputation decimated my life will be damaged I'll
be stressed to the max I'll have legal fees I'll go through all of this all
because I didn't buy her a car despite her admitting the crime because I'm a man and even worse I'm a famous man and
even worse than that I'm a masculine man so I'm the enemy of the Matrix so how can a man even fairly and
safely have a relationship anymore where is sexual consent I don't know I had sex with her 100 times was she drunk one of
those times I don't think so do I alcohol breath test her every single time no she's now saying she was drunk
I'm saying well she came over my house at 11:30 p.m. we went straight to bed I don't know I didn't know is I don't
drink I haven't drunk a drop of alcohol in a year and a half yeah but she was drunk prove it do you have have the
blood alcohol test that she was drunk no neither do I but she says she was drunk so she says the consent isn't real so
you still have to go to a trial but she admitted she lied for a BMW trial we
have we have evidence to the contrary because you said on Rob moris podcast that women can't par and that BBC rapist rapist rapist
rapist rapist rap bro what the you can't live a life anymore and the scenario
I've just described to you is 100% accurate so how are you as a man now you ask me what sexual consent is I I don't
know there is no sexual consent anymore let me let me change my answer my answer
was there's no longer a clear line of sexual consent because of diluted morality I'm going to change the answer
as a man there is never consent because if it can be snatched from you
retrospectively then you never had it you never owned it if I give you
something and I can snatch it back off of you at any time do you own it no you're borrowing it you can borrow
consent as long as you never annoy that female at any point in the future
ever good luck that's what a line of sexual consent is for a man so as a man in the
Western World you have zero consent and even if you have all of the proof I made the point about the text for the BMW
because that's very important you can have CCTV footage you can have all her texts you can have everything they will
still destroy you in the media so it doesn't matter your reputation still tarnish you lose your
job lose your bank accounts they'll still take they'll still take everything from you so there is no sexual consent
anymore for a man in the west it doesn't exist so here's a paradox I've just picked up out of that sure and that is
everything you said about what the media will do to you has made you bigger than Jesus
Christ like you are bigger than Jesus right yeah it it's made me massively it has made if it didn't work like that you
wouldn't be as big as you are correct but I'll also argue I'm in a fortunate situation
because 99% of men who was hit like I was hit couldn't have done what I've done and I'll tell you
why firstly there's the mental aspect every man thinks he's tough till it's
going on two when you have the BBC attacking you attacking your mother
attacking your family attacking the mothers of your children when your kids are getting kicked out of school when reporters are following your old mother
around when they've closed all your bank accounts down when when they're trying their very best to call all your ex-girlfriends and build up cases that
don't exist when they're printing lies about you when you know you can go to jail at any moment for nothing that's a
lot of mental stress most most people I'd argue couldn't deal with that mental stress next financially most people have
a job and your job is gone and you're broke if you have your own business you can't get customers or clients most
people I'm in a very fortunate financial situation where my finances are hard to touch and very difficult to damage in
fact they've been trying for a very long time to take down my schools the war room that's not even my main money my main money is other things I don't even
know about I can't be damaged I'm actually in the NBA I'm an NBA player never broke again so because of that I'm
also fortunate and I'm a very good speaker with a very large platform and they've
tried to cancel me and ban me which they've done normally that makes someone go away I don't go away they've tried
and I don't go away on one other platform so I can speak if I was a normal person and I got hit with that
garbage I wouldn't be bigger than Jesus Christ I'd be destroyed I'd have no money I'd have no job I'd be able to get
no customers I'd have no social media I wouldn't be able to tell my version of the truth and they'd be printing lies about me endlessly and my add all that
on top of the other mental pressure I'd be suicidal and they wouldn't care they think it was funny 99% of men who have
they've gone through what I've gone through would be a mess so i' pulled it off it's true but I speak to all the men
out there at home telling you you have no consent because if it happen to the average man he's done he is done happens
to footballers they're famous and they lose their contracts they lose everything it's crazy there's no such
thing as sexual consent in the West for a man anymore I didn't even realize that until you asked me that question I thought it was blurred because of
morality but after analyzing it it turns out it doesn't exist at all which is even worse there's no such thing as
sexual consent as a man how are you supposed to live your life I guess you just don't talk to women at all I guess
you just don't reproduce right if you have no kids you have nothing to live for you just sit there and play video games be a be a good slave pay your
taxes that's it I guess that's what they want and then they wonder why the birth rate's declining and they wonder why
they have to import all these third worlders because no one has kids anymore well how can you have kids if you can't have a wife how can you have kids if you can't have
sex we're everyone in this room and everyone watching this podcast exists
because a man went up to a woman said hello and they had sex that's what happened now if you even go up to a
woman you're a sexual predator if you go up and say excuse me I think you're beautiful that's somehow that's why
we're all here the level of Matrix attack do
people understand what's going on here Society is so fundamentally broken you
can't even exist as a man anymore your only hope the only answer is to be such
a Charming fantastic individual that women do not want to betray you and attack you which I guess is is an answer
I mean it's worked for me but you're relying on the sensibilities of other people it's kind of a scary scenario to
know that the woman you take care of in love might turn on you any moment and she can and she has all the benefit of
the doubt I don't know if this is true or not I'm just going to say
it in fact it must be true if a woman goes into a police station and makes an accusation against a man with no
evidence no evidence six years ago I had sex with the man who him
I have no text messages from him I have no video of it happening I have no video of me going to his house I don't remember where he lives I don't remember
the car I was in I don't remember anything I was drunk but I had sex with this man and I regret it he raped me
zero evidence of any kind that man would be questioned and arrested I'd argue if
I go into a police station and say I was robbed I don't remember where I don't know what they took I don't know when it
happened but I was robbed they go what do you want me to do with this what do
you mean robbed by who what well just no no evidence just just random
accusations it's scary then let's go deeper down the rabbit
hole do women hate men now if you're going to push this feminist narrative and you're going to
tell women they have to compete with men and a woman's going to buy into that and she's going to see herself in
competition with men inside the workforce or inside Society in masculine Realms is she going to feel
hateful or resentful towards men to a degree I'd argue she would because a
woman in a feminine realm will destroy a man as she should she has all the advantages and I'll sit here and say
that women in feminine Realms outperform men 100% of the time by extension in
masculine Realms men will outperform women 100% of the time so if you're going to try and turn women into men
what you're going to have is you're going to have short broke emotional men who are going to lose to big strong tall stoic men and then they're going to be
resentful of the men who do better than them and then you're going to give that resentful person power to destroy any
man's life at a whim without evidence I'm just talking out loud I
don't know is that scary it is kind of scary and then you come along and say okay well we've tried
to turn these women into men and they're not doing that well so we're going to do diversity hires and hire the women over
the men even though the men outperform them and if you look at her wrong she can destroy your life at random and you
have to pay all your taxes go build the roades and you're not allowed an opinion and if they're fat you have to find them attractive otherwise you're a misogynist
and your kids are gay don't say anything about it we go
jail Freedom democracy don't you love we live in a
free Society isn't it great Freedom it's my new book money Matrix money Matrix
free societ we live in a free Society it's so free here I feel free do
you let's go deeper down the rabbit hole talk about money Matrix it just reminded
me of something how do most tech companies
make money today they give away a free product and they use your personal
information you are the product you are the product that's right so you use Facebook or use Instagram you use a free
product and they get personal information about you and your habits and that's and they take that information and they monetize it so The
Logical extension of that fact would be that the more information they obtain about you the better they will be at
monetizing that information so that means that large companies are trying their very best to
know everything about you the harder they survey you the better their surveillance the more profitable they
will be and Company's primary objective is to be as profitable as possible meaning that tech companies and large
companies by extension which are basically government because government have the fingers in all of them want to spy on you as much as possible the
reason they want to do that is to build a pattern of your behavior and they use that pattern of your behavior to predict
how you're going to spend money or predict how they can make you spend money if we show him this type of advert
at this time for this length of time he's more likely to spend then if we don't because of all the other millions
of people who fit his profile this was the most reactive type of advertisement if you accept all of that to be true
then you must accept the next logical extension to that which means if they have all this information
on your patterns and how they can make money from you they must be trying to change your patterns huge news years in
the making my brand new book that my Publishers refuse to publish money Matrix beat the money system and build
generational wealth understand the three main ways that the banks productize you and make money from you you'll be able
to turn that system against itself build generational wealth and multiple streams of recurring income it's all at moneyat
docash and if you're quick the first few hundred registrants and buyers will receive many special bonuses from me the
brand new money maker Summit 3-day special event meet me at a champagne reception meet me at a multi-millionaire
networking dinner go now money matrix. this is huge they must have pattern a
type of person who is worth $159 and and pattern B type of person who is worth
$922 how do we make the pattern B people act like the pattern a people what do
they do different how can we change the algorithm or the app to make the pattern b's be more like the pattern A's so we
can make more money if the goal of a business is forever profit they want a forever survey and they want an ideal
customer and if they understand your patterns of behavior they must be trying to influence your patterns of behavior
the next logical extension to that is we're living in a we not only are we being spied on with absolutely everything every single thing we use is
trying to change us and change how we think and change how we act could we argue that's how you make your hundreds of millions change your people against
the Matrix to the free one speech 100% so you have me who is particularly
eloquent and concise concise is one that you are not
compendious I'm good at talking but now we have machines doing it so we're talk
about the future nii people say what do you think about AI I think AI is going to change how we all think and act I'm not worried about what the machines are
going to do I'm worried about what you're going to do you as a person I'm worried about the people are going to do when the AI becomes good enough to truly
turn turn the pattern B's into the pattern A's how do we make all the people who understand the truth believe
Andrew is a human trafficker how do we make people believe the news again what disaster do we need
have need to come up with what words do we need to type in which order in which order do we have to show them the
different articles for it to be a logical continuation in their brain for
them to come to the conclusion we want them to come to I'm not worried about what AI is going to do on its own I'm worried about it's going to do to all of
us because that's how they're making money now is by surveying us and controlling us and yeah I'm one man with
a mouth and I'm pretty good but to compete against machines into the future I'm only going to
lose so when you talk about money Matrix it just reminded me about how surveillance capitalism
I guess that's the only capitalism we have now it's surveillance capitalism I guess I I would like to and
I'm doing this on the fly so I don't know but what is communism communism is
is spying on absolutely everything somebody does to make sure they adhere to the correct Creeds so they can make a
living surveillance capitalism is spying on absolutely everything somebody does so you can make as much money as
possible from them but if they don't do the right things you'll delete their ability to exist as a human I'm sure somebody with a little
bit more time than I could draw the comparisons between surveillance capitalism and communism are we kind of reaching the same place you're spied on
absolutely we don't even have capitalism anymore in the true definition of the word where do we where do we have free
Fair markets and free competitive forces that's right and if a government's
primary objective every single day is to get more and more control which is all it is it all ends in communis anyway is
surveillance capitalism just another path towards the same thing every day
the government passes new laws every week every month whatever have you ever seen the government take a law
away so over time they just get more and more and more and more control they don't take laws away they just add new
ones on top where does that end if you have 100 Marbles and I take one away every day it ends at zero doesn't matter
if it takes a while but that's where we end up right so the governments are all going to try and end up with us in some form of slave you can call it communism
you can call it something else but this money Matrix you're talking about surveillance capitalism I don't think that's far off communism anyway I don't
think anybody you're right we have no free and fair markets we have no freedom of speech we just talked about the freedom of society how garbage that is
democracy is a scam that's a lie because they influence to control the media if the if the voting machines
work so what do we have besides God Only God can save us now my friend better
start praying cuz we ain't GL anything else there's nothing else to believe in
what else you going to believe in it's it's scary also interesting you say about the money Matrix the average
person stands so little chance of being financially free it is ridiculous how
screwed most people are they don't even know how screwed they are you know let me tell you something that's really
hilarious this mly made me laugh out loud I don't have Facebook so I'm banned
but I saw Facebook post my mom shared it with me someone someone and it was a
17-year-old who was happy that they got accepted into
college that's the biggest joke I've ever heard of so wait you are happy
you've been accepted to give them money imagine I said I was accepted to buy a
Big Mac I'm trying to give them money you accept me oh thanks so you can go to
school and learn nothing learn nothing you know what I love to do with people who go to UNI I love it because I don't
have a degree right and I'm obviously monumentally more successful than all these nerds and every once in a while I
meet somebody who whole identity is invested in their their learning and they talk to me about how
important it is blah blah BL if you want to be a doctor or I don't want to have to point out the obvious here if you
want to be a doctor you go to school I get it okay cool but whenever someone's in uni I'm like why do you go to UNI they go oh because I want to learn
things I said did you go uni today yeah what did you learn today what do you mean no today today
what did you learn today they can never answer the question it's great ask them start asking people what did you learn
today and watch them just fumble and then they realize well if I didn't learn anything on one day I probably didn't
learn anything on the week which I probably didn't learn anything the whole time all things been a SC all waste of time then you get in massive Monumental
debt debt that's the money Matrix you come out of school you're you're in debt it's over it's over for you're never going to make it you've lost the game on
level one you lost it's kind of interesting that I had
a thought experiment with somebody and I said you could only get loans for school
because if you could get loans for anything you wanted nobody would choose [Music] school because they can't exist in a
free and fair market they have to keep a monopoly over the ability to enslave
children with debt otherwise no one will choose them because there's no value in it and everyone knows there's no value
in it but how Matrix minded you have to be to actually still be happy about the idea you got accepted to a
college I I I I nearly laughed I these people have no idea how all this stuff
works they don't have a clue Rich get richer I'm sure you understand poor get poorer inflation inflation inflation
that sounds like higher house prices to me good thing I own good thing I own a bunch yeah sounds like higher share
prices good thing I own a bunch of that oh you can't buy groceries I'm sure sure that's very hard we don't have to worry
about those things we own all the assets the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and there's no way to stop it and I also feel like because I think
societies we need God and we talked about how messed up Society is I also feel like we're living in the last years
where there's a a hole in the Matrix where there's any degree of social Mobility I think we're going to end up
back at feudalism there's going to be Kings see what the talk my friends how many Ferraris know diamond
watch arguing about our diamond watches there'll be us and there'll be everyone else right now there's still a degree of
social Mobility where if you're intelligent and you're perspicacious and you're IND indefatigable and you work hard and you manage to find a gap and
you really dedicate yourself and you try your best you can make enough money to get out in 20 years the rich are going
to be rich and the poor are going to be poor and it's done it is done because the average price of a house is going to
just continue to Skyrocket the wages are not going to follow it you're never going to own any assets the assets going to be owned by all the rich people
you're going to be paying us rent it's over and there's another thing I find interesting because people come to me
often the question I get asked most is Andrew I lack motivation you have 10 years left to
save your bloodline from Eternal slavery and you lack
motivation you are born to lose sir you are a loser all of your ancestors who
fought saber-tooth tigers should have just laid down and died because they fought their best for you to be born so
you could jack off the PornHub during the last few years where you stand a chance to save your last name from
Eternal surom you are a [ __ ] and you deserve to be poor the last thing you should
lack in the mess of the world today is motivation because you are running out
of time and I'm telling you as a rich man who made it out I can see the Gap is
closing I can see it so you should certainly see it I'm above in the class
s looking down on the whole closing in you're down below looking up watching it
close and you lack motivation to build a ladder oh well maybe
tomorrow maybe government Will Save Me Maybe if I vote for the Liberals they'll give me
money slave Minds clowns fools the last thing you should lack in the world today
is motivation because truly people are running out of time and I find that extremely
interesting that not only when you go to college do you end up in a bunch of debt not only do you end up owing a bunch of
money even worse you waste time you waste years for a dream and the Matrix
is very good at this it h it dangles a carrot all the time get good gcses get
good in college get a good degree then you'll be rich pay off your mortgage you'll be rich just pay off your student loans don't worry just keep working the
carrots coming you'll get it one day when I was 16 when I saw the Ferrari
I knew this was a lie I was like there's no way that man next time you see a rich guy go up to him and say how'd you get
rich I've never heard anyone say University ever I've never heard anyone say it's a
lie it's a scam when I was 16 I saw the guy in the Ferrari I was like I'm going to college and he isn't and he ain't
going to work he knows something I don't know I knew at 16 everything they tell
me was a lie but there's still people who think they have f five years to waste in college five years I'm
37 let's conservative conservatively estimate I make for myself qu million
dollars a day let's say five years ago I was probably making 20 grand a day
that's the difference five years can make five years and they're going to sit there do what read a
book from 22 years ago go party oh
fraternity bro what's really scary is this I'm 37 I
grew up on a council estate I was broke for most of my life I made all my money myself and even I have disdain for the
poor because I look at them and go you didn't try at all I did it with all of
the pain I went through and all the problems I had while also fighting and becoming a kickboxing world champion
I still managed to do it you started at a higher bracket than me you started from a middle-income home your dad was
you had food I didn't have food that I was a world champion how did you fail so
massively and I look at them and just think of them as you're an idiot and if I feel that imagine how the elites look
at us imagine you're born into a lineage a bloodline that been in charge
the banks forever imagine how you view poor people you think you give a [ __ ] whether they live or die I'm talking
about someone who's only been Rich for 10 years and when someone comes and complains to me about being broke I'm like oh you're a dummy you didn't even
try so imagine you were born Filthy Rich and your family's always been rich and you're told about how your family's
always controlled everything because you're smarter than everybody else imagine how much disdain the elites
truly have for the common man and I'm talking as a common man who made a little bit of money then you start to
understand how this world's really working because they don't give a [ __ ] about the common man if you say to the
elites if you four third worlders into this nation you will make 3% more per
year however the common man will have to deal with crime rape murder drugs human
trafficking he'll sit there and go I don't care about the Common Man 3% okay
doesn't care why would he care then you have a community where the only people who can protect it left at the men the
men who care about their daughters care about their wives but those men have to be masculine men brave men well they're
under assault we discussed that for the last two hours so now they're afraid all the buildings look the same anyway why
don't we just move let's just move let's just let's just Scurry away then you start to lose the major cities of your
nation this hypothetical Nation the major cities start to fall everyone
starts saying stupid things like it's a nice country if you stay away from the cities you know what's a nice country if
you stay away from all the cities Afghanistan I can go hide in the forest and Afghanistan with a little tent just
sit there by myself I probably be fine I probably wouldn't get drone strike I'm on Kabul and they don't seem to understand
this and then they hide and they run away and eventually they're crushed and
it's over and the whole nation Falls and the great thing about globalists being globalists is that they have the whole
globe and then all the all the globalists get on a private jet with their families D fly to other place that
they haven't destroyed and they find a way to continue to profit off the burning trash sheep that they just
abandoned they don't care 3% more profit doesn't matter common man doesn't matter
and I'm telling you that they think like this because I catch myself and I have to correct myself thinking like
this I have there's a a guy I get this all the
time people come out to me say can you make a video from my cousin he loves you and I always refuse I don't make
videos I might make a picture but I don't make videos anyway this this particular guy showed me a picture of
the person like a picture of my cousin I looked at his cousin he must about
22 and he was standing in a crowd at a festival holding a pint and a plastic
glass and my instant thought was this guy's a [ __ ] this guy's an idiot
he's 22 I guarantee he's not a billionaire I bet I to sit down with him and say how much money you got none why are you there the Gap is closing the
elites hate you you're no longer have sexual consent you're a permanent criminal in the eyes of the law they're
here to decimate you in your entire bloodline you're 22 at the height of your capabilities the height of your
energy you heal like Wolverine it is Friday are you making money what are you
doing oh there's this band I really want to see this band then you I guess you just deserve
to lose friend I guess you're just an idiot and I don't feel sorry for you I
guess you're just a dummy and that's how I feel so imagine how the elites feel
we're scum to these people we are I'm not a rich man I'm just a poor man with loads of
money I'm from a luten counsil I wear diing watches bro you understand yeah
I'm just a poor man with billions of dollars but it's scary when you start to
understand how all these things really work and I don't think the average man at home understands this and if you
start to understand it all the last thing you will lack is motivation how can you lack motivation
how can an antelope in the jaws of a tiger say I lack
motivation I'm tired I'm horny I want to jerk off bro you're they're they're
ripping out your throat in real time you're bleeding out fight fight
[Music] back and then the Tigers like me are like like well bro you're going to get
eaten going to eat you that's what we're going to do I don't know what else I'm supposed
to do I don't it's kind of like you probably have this problem as well I don't know if you have this problem do
you ever wake up and think I don't need any more money but there's [ __ ] all else to do yeah every day yeah so you just
end up making millions what's what's better than making something out of nothing Financial Alchemy absolutely
yeah so I wake up and go let me do the math if I never worked again I could
spend $42 22,000 a day for the rest of my life I have all the cars do I need
more money no you know let me go have a coffee let me let me go let me try and chill out today and within 22 minutes
I'm back on my laptop working there's nothing else to do there's nothing else to do
and I can't stop myself working as a person who doesn't need money and then
there's people with no money who don't work it blows my mind which is why the
winners are winners and the losers are losers losers do a little bit of work and rest winners work as hard as
possible and worry they're not working hard enough it it's just a separation of of
personality types and and and it's almost like you can't save these people I have something
I I sent in my email recently I said you could give the average man a brand new Ferrari and a road map and a coffee and
a full tank of gas and tell him the Destination Success and halfway along
the drive he'll quit because it's too far how well you set it up for people they'll quit I have this the same with
my online educational platform my school it's $49 a month it's less than a Starbucks and I will teach you how to
make money online you can escape the matrix you can get out through the hole before it closes you can be geographically free you can live in
Thailand you can make money from your computer it cost $49 you have absolutely nothing to lose I made it cheap enough
for everybody to be able to join and people will sit there and
go and then put on Netflix what more I've given you a Ferrari a full tank of gas I've given
you the L I've given you a road map I've given you a haul girl to sit next to you and play songs and do selfies I've given
you everything just drive the car no yeah it's far I don't have motivation d
do you're a loser you are a loser if you do not win you lose what do you call
someone who loses a loser that is an underused word loser my brother and I
use it all the time this person thinks this he's a loser what do you mean he's a loser look at him he's a loser he lost
name a competition I beat him at anything Uno marbles a fight to the death you name it
I'll decimate this loser oh he thinks I'm a human trafficker oh he what the loser give a he's a
loser all these losers out here another thing and then they then they say this is what another thing that's amazing to
me about motivation I don't feel motivated news flash neither do I sometimes you're not
going to always feel like doing it you have to do it anyway cuz it's your duty to do it because you don't want to be a [ __ ] loser that's the whole point if
you felt like doing it all the time then there would be no magic to it
the magic is that you do it regardless of how you feel that's the whole point of it all what do you mean you need
motivation you don't have you don't need motivation you have a duty to not be a loser anymore because the hole in the
sky is
closing $49 will give you a ladder
well you know we play video games born to lose born to
lose and then they'll end up voting for some ridiculous party which promises them there won't be a loser anymore and
that party will hate people like me and they'll try and put me in jail that's what's going to happen that's the world
we currently live in the losers party losers love company they do they vote
for it losers love company there are certain political parties and movements out there that convince you that being a
loser is okay and then you feel better and you also get to blame others for
your loserdom and you feel great you don't have to take any your personal responsibility I'm not a loser because of me I'm a loser because they did it or
this happened blah blah blah blah so they they're attractive to losers and then we end up in a situation
we're currently in who's better with women Andrew Tate or Tristan Tate Tristan 100% Tristan why I've retired
bro I'm retired Tristan's the Mr Ladies Man Tristan Tristan and I are the perfect
team because we're opposites people think we're the same but we're not we're actually very difficult sorry very
different Tristan enjoys life Tristan enjoys
life do I enjoy life well you say life is war it is
War I don't think I I don't think I consciously very often enjoy anything
the things I I enjoy are not fun things are you enjoying this this is work it's
fun I mean I like to talk yeah it's fun it's fun but like if what would give me
more satisfaction going to a very expensive restaurant with 10 beautiful women and
popping loads of bottles of champagne and eating really great food and driving home in a fast car or clearing all my
work notifications I think the notifications might give me a higher dopamine hint I'll be perfectly honest with you that's
true Tristan will love that TR would enjoy the whole thing I'd be there and I'm he'd love the 10 women you me and
you'd love the work the work yeah I think you have to be smart enough to realize most things in the world are
garbage but stupid enough to enjoy the garbage so I can I can put myself in a frame of mind where I'll sit at that
table and I won't enjoy it but I'll sit and say everyone like like me stealing
everyone's dreams with the cars I'm like this is every man's aspiration everyone else at this club wishes they were at
this table with the most beautiful women with the nicest cars outside and the biggest steak and balls of champagne
whatever I'll sit there me and I'm cognitive enough to look and say yes
this is fun but really it's just because no one else can do it am I actually enjoying it no I'd rather just go home
and work I don't really care but it has to be done just to make other people sad my brother and I my brother and I used
to talk about this it was actually we used to say this a few years ago back when I used to drink I don't drink anymore but he'd say are we going to the
club tonight I like I don't want to go he goes but Andrew if we don't go other men get girls at their
tables cuz if we go we get every single female in the club at our table I was
like yeah I don't want to go and I don't want females near me really but do I want to give them to everyone else no
all right then maybe maybe I'm just Petty maybe I'm spiteful who knows but we'd go just
so no one else could have any fun but Tristan enjoys life so so and
and that's what I love about him because if I want to enjoy life I can tap into his energy and he can tap into my energy when things need doing and that's why
like going to prison like going to jail that's right that's why we're a very good
team but um yeah I I'm I'm cerebral enough to pretend to enjoy things but if
I'm actually honest there's very little I actually enjoy I enjoy fighting I enjoy working I enjoy driving fast cars competitively like racing and stuff
besides that I don't care is one of the best things about having the watches the cars
and the Fantasy Life is understanding the reality that that is not the fantasy life I think the best thing about it
being honest that no one else going to have it I be I'm telling you what I enjoy I enjoy having things other people
can't have I enjoy using Finance to assert my dominance I enjoy peacocking
with my feathers hahaa I enjoy is that one of the more honest Andre very honest
it's the L the lamentation of of losers is beautiful to me I love it I love
people complaining about the energy bill and I'm filling up my sf90 going yeah
must be really hard oh 200 pounds wow makes me happy I I it's a seting
dominance I'm better than you look I have metrics measurable metrics numbers
nice and simple you understand numbers is two more than one okay cool right
billion unlucky you tried your
best I love that I think every man does I think that male happiness comes
through the feeling of superiority I think men are happy when they feel better I think we're naturally
competitive that's why we've always done what we've done why did gask Khan need Vienna bro that's Austria look at map
why did he need Vienna it took him probably three months to even hear they were at Vienna by the time he got the
message they probably already conquered it why did he need it because he wanted it why do I need the stuff I have
because other people can't have it it's mine and I think that that's where
masculine happiness comes from because I think men are happy when they feel respected and you're going to respect
yourself if you look around and you have things other people don't have it's very easy I I don't want to be
called arrogant wait sorry I don't give a [ __ ] if I'm called arrogant because
sure there's people who say he thinks he's so great and I can sit and say yeah you're right I think I'm so great and I
know that angers you but let's actually measure and I'll prove to you that I am
great I'm not trying to insult anyone I'm not trying to be unlikable I'm saying I am great look get the average
man the average statistics put my statistics next to them put and chat gbt and say which one's
greater what do you what do you want I enjoy that feeling why do I walk into
the showroom and buy the two available cars that I don't want because it's one man's dream and now another man can't buy
them now they're mine that's just it and I think that if every man's honest with
himself that's what every man wants if you get away with all the Matrix garbage and all the Matrix has told you all this
crap like be humble and all this other garbage throw it away why do you play sports
to win to win why do you want to put a ball in a net more times than the other people to show that you're better than
them at putting a ball in a net how insignificant an action a ball in a net
who cares a much more significant action would be making a bunch of money or
being physically stronger or a better fighter or being smarter a quicker talker or being more well-known more
respected more influential that's far more important than putting a ball in the net and you'll spend your time putting a ball in the net to prove
you're better than other people so don't sit and say that I'm a bad person for proving I'm better than everyone else by
all the things I'm doing that's masculine competition by extension the men who do
not think like me the losers because you lose if there's a game being played and
some men realize it's a battle and some men don't realize there's a battle going on how can they possibly win so some of
you men are waking up every day not realizing you're in a forever permanent comp competition with every single man
around you for everything all of the time and that doesn't ever cross your mind and you wonder why you permanently
lose well it crosses my mind and that's why I'm beating you women want the men who think this
way women want the men who understand this who win that's who women want so
you can call it arrogant you can call it egotistical I call it winning I call it
realism I call it realistic and the best things about having most of the things I have is
other people can't have them that's the bottom line of it it's the reason why billionaires buy a bigger yacht than the
billionaire next to them they do not need an extra 20 feet of deck space they
want the biggest yacht in the harbor is the reason why they buy oneof one picassos it's the reason why when
Bugatti launch a new car with 0 units they're all sold same day that's why
because winners all think the same way and anyone who sits and goes well you should be more humble
I hear that sometimes and then I look at who said it to me and whenever someone tells me their
opinion this is a habit I give everyone at home whenever somebody gives you their opinion on anything listen to the
opinion and then stop and look at who told it to you because you never want to adopt the thinking of somebody who you don't want to be because their thinking
made them so whatever they believe in their mind is why they are the person they are so if somebody sits and says to
you you should be more humble I say sit and think okay it's my logical this is how my brain works he believes I should
be more humble that's how his mind operates the closer my mind operates to his mind the more likely I am to be like
him who is he and I'll look at the person who said that to me and say no
thank you no sir I refuse it being humble is that how you got to where you
are is that how you got no you you keep humble I'll keep winning and you can
give because most people who talk about humble all they really want is not be reminded of how they have failed they
don't want me to make it clear to them that they have failed they have failed and I even
think we talk about like the normal man and the normal life and we'll talk about that in a second but normality now is
being scoped from all angles I feel like in the 1950s a normal man was a winner
the normal man went to a normal job and had a normal family in a normal house in
a normal car and a normal life but I feel like the normal person now is two F
two parents working children being raised by The Matrix in school being bombarded with propaganda bills barely
paid depressed angry anxious watching the BBC a philic normality has been
changed from being a winner to being a loser so now being normal is just losing
in a way which is so familiar to the people around you are losing that you don't realize you've lost at all because
everyone's losing so you're like oh I'm just normal no no you've all lost you've all lost none of you are free you've all
lost and that's even more scary you can't even be normal anymore to be a winner you have to be exceptional you
could be a winner as a normal person only 50 60 years ago now the normal people can't even win because they
they're they're grinding down society that the bracket of normal is going further and further
down and then you can by extension that makes it more scary right because in the 1950s I guess you could wake up and say
this want to be a normal Law Abiding Citizen I want to be normal and I want to follow the law and you'll have a good
life and you'll be a winner you'll be respected at home your wife will love you you'll raise children you'll be religious you'll worship God you'll pay
your bills normal law abiding if you're a normal law- abiding person not
nowadays not only are you broke you can't talk because it's hate speech like
if you follow the laws now and you're just normal law- abiding person not only are you broke you're matrix-m minded
listen to the BBC yeah I guess we need to go bumb the hooes Bro who two weeks we now we're
bombing the htis in Yemen cool two weeks ago if you were to go around the world
round England and ask people who were the hooes 99.9% of people couldn't even tell you who they
were no one even knew who they were now we're convinced we need to blow them up
you even know who these people are news don't normal well I guess if the MPS
believe because it's normal I'm in debt it's crazy it's crazy
so and it's normal people telling me to be humble so this is this is why it doesn't enter my my mind when they're
like you need to be more humble I'm like okay you're a normal person here's your life here's what you believe that's fine I don't believe in that and then I look
at my life and sorry that now I make a point here that's clear though I don't
want men to then become delusional don't think you're great when you're not don't
be delusional everything I've talked about here is metrics measurable metrics
numbers as a man you need to live in the real world or you're not going to be competitive because we're competing in the real
world so you need to be able to do amazing things and then be proud of yourself don't sit and think you're
great for no reason that is arrogance I'd argue that the normal person who thinks they're so unique and great for
no reason is more arrogant than me I was the most famous man in the world I'm allowed to say that was measured it's
numbers it's Google so I think the best mental model as a man is to understand that you
cannot be normal you need to be exceptional you need to do exceptional things that ties into the exceptionally good and the exceptionally bad like we
talked earlier which means you need to be hard on yourself so you can deal with the exceptionally bad and if you start to do all these things they all compound
everything I've said across all these hours all tie into each other and you end up in one result you end up in one place which is BR brutal competence
brutal masculine competence there's nowhere else to be and through that brutal masculine competence you can also protect yourself from all the things we
were talking about earlier from The Matrix brutal masculine competence will put you in a position of respect where
your girlfriend you haven't seen in seven years your ex is called and she goes I respect him too much to rat on
him maybe he loves someone else now but I just won't rat on him I respect him only brutal mascul competence can save
you law won't save you Law's against you nothing will save you besides your own brutal
competence does money make you happy or happier I wouldn't be happy balls broke
M money okay so to to not I answered about how having things other people can't have makes me happy so it makes me
happy for that reason because it's the vehicle to it because it's the vehicle to it so that's one answer but I'll give
another answer money to me now is
like hands hear me out I use it all the time
and I'm glad I have it I don't consciously think I'm super glad I have hands right maybe occasionally if I see
somebody without hands I'm like thank God I have hands but most of the time you just expect it to be there you just use your hands right you expect it to be
there you take it for granted if I lost my hands I would be devastated I don't
appreciate them as much as I should I should appreciate them more cuz I could lose them at any point and that's
exactly how I view money because if I want something I just take it the world for me is free I try to explain this to
people and they don't understand I'm like when you're as rich as me the only way it feels is that everything is free if I see something and I want it I just
say I'll take that it's free it's like it's like imagine there's no more prices on things the only reason I don't take
something is because I don't want it or I don't want to deal with putting up with it or putting it somewhere because I already have so much stuff everything
is free all the time I go into a clothing I go to Louis Vuitton yeah give me this this this this give me this bro
I'll go into Louis Vuitton and there's a tracksuit and I can't be bothered to try it on I'll buy all four sizes and I'll work out later which one fits and I'll
throw the others away everything's free it doesn't matter I don't want to take my jacket off put it on headache so
that's that's how it feels now if I had to go back to being broke I would be like you didn't appreciate being rich nearly enough but I'm in the NBA so that
can't happen to me but that's how money feels does money make me happy
happy okay do my hands make me happy well no I don't wake up and go I'm happy
I have hands no but if I didn't have hands I'd probably be a lot less happy
it's a requirement for happiness that I just expect to be there what's interesting
is we talk about how I expect to just have money beautiful women expect men to just
have money even more there's a beautiful girl I knew some years ago blah blah blah I was talking to her and she was
saying money won't get a girl a girl doesn't want a man for money unless he's
unless she's a prostitute and it's like a purely transactional relationship she said money will qualify you to try every
man I talk to has money I'm beautiful I would never speak to a man who has no money in my world
all men just have money I don't know how of course you have money you're a man that's how they view Money beautiful
girls think men just have money like like men just have hands and legs and money they don't care how you made it
they don't care how hard it was to make they don't care how much stress you go through to get it in her world every
single man she has ever replied to on Instagram ever was rich so men just have
money and the men who don't have money don't even exist don't exist to her we're sitting in a restaurant and when
we left I said how many men were in that restaurant she goes four or five it's like no there was 20 waiters you didn't
see there's the kitchen staff at the back you didn't see there's a security guard in the valet out front they're
invisible to you they don't even cross your mind you just see the diamond watches that's how they view the world
so you're talking about this money make me happy well yeah I think it's a bare minimum requirement of existence I
expect to have it like I expect to have my hands by extension beautiful women expect you to just have
money if I sat with a beautiful girl and said oh yeah I can't afford that she'd be like what you're a man what do you mean you can't afford it like like
you're like like you're missing a DI or something it's just this the world we live in it's the world we live in not
you're missing like you have more than one if it's big enough it can count for two but but but yeah so I couldn't be
happy broke and I know I'm always going to have money and I expect to have money all of the time but it's like my hands I
don't I don't know how else to explain it it's like my hands I I don't know I I couldn't be happy without money I I don't know how a man is waking up and
he's happy without money well I think I've written books on money done a lot
of exploration I actually think the rhetoric that money doesn't make you happy and life isn't all about money is
part of the propaganda of what you call the Matrix in indoctrinating us to
concede and and just enough so that we can pay our 50% taxes and pay our interest sto all of our loans and then
when we die pay 40% of everything that we own cuz if we know that money makes us really happy we'll go and find it
which means becoming an entrepreneur and getting out of the system and then that is freedom oh absolutely so I think the
smartest thing the rich people ever did was convince the broke people that money doesn't make you happy I think that's
nail nail on the head all the rich people like don't worry guys don't worry
money doesn't make you happy guys I'm going to keep
mine but no worry it doesn't make you happy I promise I promise I'm sad promise you're sad yeah we're both are
good luck biggest scam alive because money is freedom it's freedom to drive
what you want eat where you want go where you want it's freedom to sleep with who you want I just described it if
you want a beautiful woman you need money like to to money is freedom if you if you don't want to be a slave which is
it's freedom to say no money is freedom to say no it's freedom to talk the truth online and be put in jail and come out
and still have supercars there's a lot of men who think what I think they can't say it they lose their jobs so you want
to say money doesn't buy happiness well then you're saying you're happy to be a slave because only money is going to give you Freedom when they want to try
and attack you let they've attacked me they take your money away on purpose so absolutely money's freedom to have an
opinion now so it's true so you're yeah exactly so so money absolutely is
happiness because freedom is a bare minimum requisite to happiness unless you're happy being a slave and
you're right about what rich people did they tried to convince all the people at the bottom that money isn't the answer
you're never going to be more happy poor you may as well you may as well be
rich I can't think of many scenarios where being rich was a detriment over being poor there's not many even if
money can't help you you may as well have it right so I completely agree with you I think money is a bare minimum
requirement for happiness especially if you're a masculine man who wants to out compete then you need money because money is basically everything I think
money is the most important thing in the world is health because you have nothing if you're dying second thing is is
family and friends who you love and the third is money because it's everything else it's literally everything else is
money and they've convinced people the poor people oh yeah he has money but you know I have friends and family who love
me so do I so do I that it's like because I have
money I don't have friends and family where did I get to spend more time with my friends and family than you do cuz
you're working a slave job they they've they people are sced
into thinking that rich people are somehow lacking somewhere else and I'm sure some of them are but not all of them there are some people that have
everything they just going to have to accept it some people just have it all they have friends and family and good
relationships and love their kids and a bunch of money and if that doesn't anger
you to get up and make a bunch of money well I don't know what will you know I always found the one thing that was always amazing to me and this happened
to me even just the other day I'll be driving one of my 59
supercars and uh I don't braging
try and it's raining and it's dark and it's cold and I see people at a bus stop
and I'm at the traffic light I'm like it's freezing and it's raining and it's
nighttime and you can't can't afford an Uber if that won't motivate you I don't
know what will because the worst thing about the bus isn't the bus it's the time you wait for the bus time is money
you're going to sit down there for 45 minutes in the freezing cold and waste
your time to save a couple dollars on an Uber and you don't feel Panic to get
rich and you're just fine with that and you're going to come home took the bus today
bro born to lose born to lose if that won't motivate you especially as my 5.2
L V10 Lamborghini is humming right next to you standing there
you're standing with your coat on your hood up Lamborghini's right there wonder when the Buffs will come
been a while today bro bro born to loose
so how do you get rich then because whilst I agree with you some people just
don't yet know what to do well okay so first thing I want to do is I will teach
everyone what to do inside of my school and I'm going to have to plug this school because it's very important and I'll tell you why plug the out I'm going
to plug it and I'll tell you why the reason I launched my Academy is not for me to make money I was already rich my
Academy exists for the reason we just discussed if you want to be free of mind you need to have money therefore if my
goal is to attack and defeat The Matrix I need people who have money who can
tell the truth if you're a fan of mine and you work a broky job you're no use to me because you can't speak because
you'll lose your job and you cannot feed your family if you're a fan of mine and you're making millions of dollars then
you can tell the truth and you can back me up and support me and you can Echo
and you can amplify my sentiments therefore I want all of my fans to make
as much money as possible I'm not a philanthropist I'm not doing this because I care about all the people but
I'm genuinely from a selfish point of view trying to make all of my fans as rich as possible so we can all tell the
truth that is why my Academy is so cheap so anyone can join it and it will teach you how to make money online so if
you've SP sat here for hours and listened to everything I've said and agreed with all of it and still have not
joined the academy then there's something wrong with you in your mind because you obviously respect my point of view and you obviously know I know what I'm talking about and now I'm
telling you I'll teach you how to get rich and you still don't join the then you're a broken person and I can't help
you or maybe they don't know the link good good point join the real world
you can type in the real world on Google and you'll see the link or go to cobratate tocom H you it's there and you
can join that's how I teach people to make money online but to give a more overall answer outside of the plug for
the Academy which I'll once again reiterate if you're not inside of I don't know what's wrong with you I think the easiest way to make
money in the world today is to sell information I think selling
information if you were to tell me what's the quickest way to get rich I think providing information or because
we live in an attention economy finding a way to solicit attention and then selling information is probably one of
the easiest ways to make money in the world today i' like to argue that everybody
knows something so I I I like to challenge myself so give me a normie job
give me a normal job name a normie job making coffee making coffee boom you're a barista you're a barista now I'm gonna
tell you how to get rich as a barista because I can think that fast off the top of my head the problem with most people in the world today is not that
they do a normal thing is that they do a normal thing and they don't try to be the best at it so you can be a barista and you can just make coffees or you can
be a barista that makes the fancy coffees and can turn over all the cups and do like the the tricks and all the
garbage we have a man who became a billionaire from Salt yes from Salt you can all put salt on he did it the best
bam so the first thing you need to do is get very at making coffees that's the first thing you need to do be able to do it in a fancy way then you need to
solicit attention well you can make coffees in a fancy way and you can hire a videographer you can then begin to make fancy coffees in a fancy way and
you can make it look good with a finalized product and you can get a nice video made that's well cut with some fancy music you begin to put them on
Instagram and solicit people to watch your Instagram page now you have attention how do you then turn that
attention into money after you began to show your fancy coffees well you could let's say put together a course or an
academy or write a book on the magic of coffee or the secrets of coffee and you
would put a mystery on it don't say I'll teach you how to make coffee no say the secrets of coffee and you'd have a link
in your Instagram page and it would be $9 and it would tell people the secrets how to make coffee for example you'd
start to sell that for $9 you'd make a couple hundred or a couple thousand not too much but you continue to make fancy coffees people continue to go to your
Instagram page you're now selling the secrets of how to make coffee then after people start knowing you as being a barista you start to make these $9 you
have 20 $30,000 in the bank what you can do is want your own coffee brand you can go to alibaba.com you can find some coffee beans you can put your face on it
because your face is not a recognized brand you can get your own coffee beans you can begin to sell them on Instagram before you know you're making 1010 or $15,000 a month you can start to do
tours you could start to put posters on your Instagram or in your Instagram stor saying I'm going to do master classes on
how to make coffee 20 people only $1,000 each at this premium Barista speciality
coffee shop in London the coffee shop will allow you to do it for free because they want people to know get the advertising from you and your brand
you'll charge $1,000 each that's 20 grand for a day to teach people how to pour milk in a cup boom you've got a
coffee brand you got an online school you're doing seminars you were a nobody you worked in Starbucks you were a loser
you put in a little bit of effort now you drive a Ferrari done by extension anyone who does not drive a Ferrari is a
lazy idiot it is that easy to get rich in the world today if you actually try nobody drives instead he'll go to
work every day make the coffees go home off some people are so lazy that they
will work every day instead of get rich and they think because they're working every day that they're not lazy I'll
argue you're exceptionally lazy because you're so lazy that instead of trying
and thinking outside of the box you now have to enslave yourself for eternity that's how lazy you are nothing lazier
than a man with a 9 to-5 CU he ain't trying the hole in the ceiling is
closing it's closing this won't work forever but it will work everything I
just told you about that could work for an electrician could do the same thing teach people how to wire a plug who
gives a you'll make some money if you try my online school teaches 18 modern
wealth creation methods everything I just told you there is not actually inside of the school we have 18 other modern wealth creation methods when you
join there's a quiz and it says do you have money to invest most people say no do you have time you either have money
or time you have one of the two we'll turn your time into money or we'll turn your money into money and you can join $49 a month will teach you absolutely
everything we have hundreds of thousands of students but there's hundreds of thousands people who don't join and they're just destined to lose so you ask
how can people make money well let's go deeper down the rabbit hole let's imagine every Barista who
watches this now tries my idea the winner is going to be one the person who makes the most beautiful coffee the
person who makes the most beautiful videos person who works the longest who tries the hardest who makes the most videos who makes his $9 secrets of
coffee book that sells on Amazon the best book who gives the most value in his master class who gets the best
coffee beans for his coffee brand then it comes down to hard work people say work smart not hard disagree work smart
and hard because lots of people are working smart if you have five people working smart and the one who works
hardest he's going to win I work smart and hard work work hard on the right
thing absolutely so there's no avoiding the hard work this idea that you can work smart and not hard I I don't I
don't buy that I believe you're going to have to work hard you have to work on the right thing and work smart first if you don't work smart you're not on the you're not on the starting line working
smart puts you on the starting line then you got to work hard to to win the race because there a load of broke people working really hard isn't they
absolutely they're not working smart you need both so then for all the Baristas who have watched this who've decided to
take that idea which I've given you for free you're welcome the one of you that works hardest is going to be the one that makes the money and then perhaps if
you make a bunch of money you can join the war room and then you can come and speak to one of us in person and I'll say how did you get rich and say say I
watched your interview with Rob Mo and I stopped working in Starbucks and say you're welcome you owe me a
car forari please 34 are you going to launch your own
crypto no I'm never going to launch a crypto I just like to with crypto Twitter because crypto Twitter are full
of the biggest degenerate losers on the planet they're losers crypto is the only scenario I can think of where you can
make a whole bunch of money while benefiting Society zero
even if you do something bad in a normal company let's say you have a company and you you get blood diamonds from Earth
that's bad but you do something good you know you you manage to make a woman happy with an engagement ring you manage
to make a security contractor Happy by paying him a bunch of money to point the AKs at the children you do something
good for someone crypto is unique where somebody can take a $100 and make a million dollars and benefit Society 0%
they never help anyone at any point and they never learn any lessons along the way if you make money the way you've
made money or I've made money you learn how to speak you learn how to deal with stress you learn how to manage people you learn banking you learn taxes you
learn things if you make a bunch of money on a crypto pump you have learned nothing you've learned nothing and
benefited nobody it is the lazy person's dream to buy a sh coin it blow up then
be rich with no work no net benefit to the universe and because the world is cyclical because there's no light
without dark because God is just these people always end up going broke because they never learn any skills if I lost
everything today I know how to make it all back better and faster than before because of the lessons I learned making
it the first time these people know nothing all they know is to gamble so they gamble again lose more borrow money
gamble again lose more crypto Twitter is full of degenerate losers and I love to play games with them because they would
love to be launch your coin because they make a bunch of money but the problem is some people would make a bunch of money
and a bunch of others would lose money there's no such thing as free money for everyone who wins someone else must lose
if you buy a coin for a dollar and sell it for $10 someone bought it at $10 if it then goes down the person who bought
it at $10 loses money I do not want any of my fans to ever lose money in my name ever because I don't need money so I
refuse to sell out my fans for money I am not Logan Paul I will not do that so for that reason I will never launch a
crypto sometimes I say I don't launch a crypto and I watch crypto Twitter go into a dest
jerk off and have a mental breakdown about how much money they can scam from others because they're lazy these are
lazy idiot people and they hide behind their little cartoon display pictures and they just want to just scam money
they don't want to do any real work I just like to prod them because you know
it's funny none of them have my life none of them have my money none of them ever will and the great thing about it is Imagine one of these crypto losers
became a billionaire say he bought coin everything went well he became billionaire great we have the same amount of money now cool I can still rip
his throat out and he's still a dork and he still can't speak like I can speak
and he still can't go through through the things I've been through and he still can't get women the way I can he still can't be respected when he walks
down the street the way I am he's still a nobody money won't save you money
amplifies if you're a nerd and you get rich you become a mega nerd if you're a
g and you become rich you become top g a car is a simplest proof if you see a
tech dork pull up in a Lambo and get SS skinny little dork you're like super nerd the lambo makes him a bigger nerd
you see me get out at 3:00 in the morning you're scared think I'm a drug dealer or a m
boss amplifies money will not change who you are it will amplify who you are which means these crypto losers the
worst thing that could happen to them is that they actually get rich because then they become Mega losers you need the
struggle to become a man only the pain will give you wisdom you only want a
crypto pump because you're scared of pain and you're scared of trouble and struggle that's why you want a crypto
pump in the first place so when I talk about crypto I'm
just poking the artists I'm just poking the idiots you know me I'm just having fun with them and and and I'll be honest
I made a bunch of money on crypto I've made a bunch of it's not who I am it's not my personality I find that amazing
anyone who's been follow me for a very long time has seen some of my OG tweets I was in pancake at like 40 cents and that went up to I know $50 or something
I made I don't know $60 70 million of crypto but imagine that becoming your
personality what kind of loser are you to make some money from an internet digital money and then make it your
profile picture and change your display name my I'm Andrew Tate I'm a kickboxing world champion I'm Andrew Tate that's
who I am as a man imagine I became bitcoin. eth putting up a Bitcoin symbol I'm a
yeah I'm a Bitcoin maximalist that's you that's your personality that's everything you are I look at these
crypto influencers man there's some of them on YouTube during the Bull Run they were big like influencer crypto
influencers Bitcoin there's one guy who yells all the time I don't know where he's from Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin
Bitcoin bro you are never ever ever going to have a woman who loves you ever not
truly not deep in her heart not ready to die for you not ready to shoot at the cops while you escape you won't I will
cuz I'm me all what do you talk about the blockchain nobody cares nobody cares
you made a bit of money great fine why is it your personality get a in life
crypto twit is full of losers such losers I would argue we could line up
10,000 of them here on the street and I would face them all in Mortal Kombat one by
one and I guarantee I might be a little bit out of breath when the 10,000th man
falls in a lifeless pile on on the floor you will understand why I prod crypto
Twitter they're nobody's probably with a cigar in your mouth I would a shame
power up first [ __ ] them nerds and [ __ ] the crypto influencers they're the biggest nerds of all biggest nerd I wish
I knew their names this one guy was always screaming I did a I did a video about nfts as well that was hilarious
there are people who spent $5 million on a JPEG row on a JPEG people were trying to get
me to invest in nfts and I said no I'm morally again so you'll make money I don't want to make money that way I want
to make money with hardship and struggle I'm going to run my University I'm going to have morning meetings with my
professors I'm going to hold them accountable for teaching the students how to make millions of dollars I'm have the war room we're going to do events
it's going to be hard I'm going to manage everyone and we're going to put together this huge network of people who are genuinely benefiting I do not want
to make money from buying a JPEG for a dollar and selling it for $2 I don't give a [ __ ] about that I refuse people
were saying to me yo you don't understand it's not just a jpeg bro it's on the blockchain bro and you can see on
ether scan who owns it bro you are never going to be loved
by a woman ever ever never will she look at you with desire she'll look at you
and go I guess I kind of have to it's been a few months he does pay the rent that's that's the best you can hope for
with your internet coins and I'm and this is from someone who's made money with crypto I have never sat
you know what I find amazing about crypto when I was making millions and millions of dollars of crypto I never
sat there and tried to convince anyone else crypto guys can't help this I'd sit down at a table let's say Bitcoin had
just pumped and I made $20 million so what do you think about Bitcoin I go buy it if you
want that's it you ask a crypto guy about Bitcoin now I'm talking to someone with over a thousand Bitcoin if someone
ask me about Bitcoin now I have over a thousand someone says what do you think about Bitcoin I said you can buy if he wants an investment that's that's the
end ask someone with 1.4 Bitcoin about Bitcoin whoa the money is a scamming
because the blockchain Nakamoto Satoshi shut the [ __ ] up you're broke
you're broke you're broke nobody cares buy new shoes your shoes are all dirty
tie your shoelaces these losers have so much to say and no money I don't understand why
are you trying to convince someone else to buy Bitcoin you no money go get a job
get a job I think I don't know I'm someone with loads of crypto and someone goes
what do you think about crypto I do what you want because if I tell them to buy and it goes up they won't give me any
money and if it goes down they'll cry their eyes out so why am I even talking to this person nothing to do with me you do what you want make your own decisions
you're a full-grown man whenever I see a broki where was I I was
in I think it was Miami and they had one of these big bit coin conventions or something crypto
things and I was in my blackedout Escalade with my private security with their guns of course and I and I knew it
was going on I was like just pull up outside we're driving around Miami we pull up outside and I just sat there for like five minutes watching the people
going in Imagine This imagine you're watching this right now and you're and you're a Bitcoin dork and you went to an
event in Miami about a year and a half ago you might have only been a few meters away from Top G I might have been
watching you you were walking in an hour and I was sitting in that black Escalade looking out the tinted window I just
looked at all these people and I just thought and loser loser loser loser and loser loser let's go
guys losers so that's a no yeah that's a no sorry crypto Twitter you know what
the funniest thing is I'm not done with these nerds funniest thing is
this the best thing a crypto dork could do if he made money would be invest in
himself because he's a nerd with money now right so like look at Zuckerberg he's doing Jiu-Jitsu he's training he's
realized that money cannot make up for all his obvious deficiencies so he has to invest in himself the problem is
crypto's made the money so easily they're not used to struggle or hardship so they're not even going to be able to
invest in themselves if I was a crypto dork and I made money I would message me Andrew Tate and say I'm a loser but I'm
super rich I'll pay you a million dollars a day to teach me how to speak like you and teach me how to fight and make me train
please but they but they haven't even got the self they're not even smart enough to
look at themselves in the mirror and realize that's what they should do with the money you know what they'll do with the money buy a buy a car buy a Gucci
t-shirt says Gucci Gucci then they'll buy an nft so they
can brag to their other nerds I got the board AP 3.2 [Music]
board life then they'll hire some hookers sniff some coke then they'll spend it all then they'll try and gamble
again losers if they would have invested in themselves at least they'd become somebody upgrade your character in the
video game of life we're living in a simulation upgrade your character become a superhero as the levels of life go on
the bosses get harder and harder to beat that's why you have to upgrade your character that's the whole point of it no nerds I will never launch a crypto
ever for that reason because I don't want have anything to do with these dorks also another reason I'm not
done I'm not you when you have hundreds of millions of dollars you're not
interested in these super huge pumps super huge pumps are for brokies I'm happy to buy Bitcoin and
make a 10% return if I put in 100 million make a 10% return it's fine why would I take a risk the only reason
these people want to turn $100 into a million is because they're poor which means they have to take the biggest gambles I don't need to gamble I'm
Bitcoin eth I'm done I need gamble this junk so I will never launch a coin I
will never sell out my fans we have the real world which will teach you how to make money for real we have the War Room
which will give give you the mask and Brotherhood you need to resist oppression that is it I don't need to launch anything else so we've talked about cars money
watches and assets we've talked about crypto and all of this goes around to me thinking
there's one way that trumps all of them that you've made money and it's also how
I've made a few hundred million in sales
and that is through speaking through through your voice your energy your
personality that you articulate in such a way that you can move hearts and minds
and create a movement and get people to change and pay you for that change I
agree with you a transfer of energy yeah from where they were to where they want to go a an inspiring them to see a
better future and when people can see a better future in themselves they'll pay the person who can take them there yeah
and that's made you maybe that's made you the billionaire yes you're right it
has but I would argue that it's struggle that made me a billionaire because it's
struggle that taught me the lessons and then I learned to articulate the lessons in a way people can understand so that's the vehicle yeah struggle has always
been the vehicle for man right if you or is the struggle the
engine yes you know what a perfect example if you watch any I've noticed this it's a observation of mine if you
watch any Superhero Movie bad things happen to him then he becomes a superhero every time Batman's
parents died he gets to become a superhero so I think that's pretty obvious in the masculine frame bad
things have to happen to you for you to become a superhero but then bad things have to happen but that breaks most people and you have to figure out how to
turn that into good correct absolutely and that's also why you have
to be hard on yourself but that's also why you need to see bad things as a a blessing because they're the building
blocks to make you the man you want to be when when people say to me this bad thing happened to me I say good that's
my that's my instant response this girl left me good I lost all my money good
what do you mean good good this is your chance to take all of that negative emotion all of those building blocks and
turn yourself into a man that prevents these bad things happening to them ever again now of course you have to have the
agency to do that you're right if you're going to be broken by it then you're going to fail but bad things are certainly a blessing
I believe that's how God teaches I would actually argue that men only learn through pain I think we only learn that way I don't think men know how to learn
the easy way I can speak for myself how many times men are men are pretty simple
we'll we'll cheat on our girl and almost lose her and we'll cheat on our girl and almost lose her and we'll cheat on our girl and almost lose her and we'll cheat on our girl and almost lose her and then
we'll cheat on our girl and she'll leave and we'll be like we had our chances we won't take
them that's just how we are we'll drive that car and almost crash 100 times it's only after we plow it into a tree that
we'll learn a lesson do you know we have our board meetings and whenever things are going well we never really thres it out we only thres it out when things are
not going well that way always always always that's how we are we learn through pain and suffering which is why God gives it to us because God is here
to teach us God is like a father and a father teaches you I believe through pain if a dad wants to teach you how to
ride a bike he puts you on the bike let you fall off and get hurt puts you back on the bike over and over and over until you can ride the bike God does the same
thing you don't get the lessons you want get the lessons you need you need absolutely agree so I believe that bad
things happening to you are a fantastic thing I believe you need to be strong enough to deal with them and then articulate them I do find it amazing
that a lot of people can't speak well I find that truly amazing if you don't have the ability to project your thoughts to other people I don't know
how you're going to be successful in life the reason I refuse to learn other language is because I haven't learned English yet there's words I don't know
and English is the most profitable language for me to know so I'm going to learn English if I want to spend time learning a language I'll read the
English dictionary I'm not going to learn another language just to stuttering like a dummy but there are people who've been speaking English
their entire life and they can't even speak it it's actually a a pet peeve of mine you know when you said earlier
about being rich allows you to say no I'm going to be very honest I am the worst person to pitch to I get people
trying to pitch me for business and I'm the worst because if you're a vegan
no if you turn up in a Prius or a Tesla no no I'm nothing against Tesla don't
ban me Elon but but if somebody cannot project their ideas to me succinctly I
instantly dis just dislike them because maybe I have ADHD maybe I'm too busy I don't know what it is but I don't have
time for your ums and a I don't have time for it so if I'm sitting in a meeting and somebody goes um so
uh we're going to start with um and this is how people
speak You're a full grown man and you can't finish a sentence without saying
all or a in the only language you know you've been speaking it for 40
years it bothers me it's a pet peeve of mine it irks me occasionally we make
mistakes fine whatever but if you actually listened to most people speak that's how most people communicate with
the world you wonder why you can't convince a girl to sleep with you um uh
um yours are nice um dummy you're a dummy no wonder you can't make any
money you're idiot this is people in and a on their way through life it bothers
me when people come to pitch me if they say or a too much in the first sentence it's over like sorry sir when you learn
to talk English when you learn to speak I might give you another chance goodbye so you're right the ability to
project the thoughts inside of your mind in a way that other people can digest and is also entertaining is massively a
superpower how do you develop that superpower it's not through practice
people think it's practice practice doesn't make perfect because because you can practice a really bad habit and get
really good at a really [ __ ] thing absolutely yeah the person who ums and a at 48 has been practicing his whole
life he's practiced just fine great he's great feedback is what's important you
have to analyze I'll give you an example when I was playing chess as a kid I would play chess for two hours a day
training under my father one hour would be play one hour would be going back through the games and analyzing the
games I always enjoyed playing but I hated analizing but it was the analysis
that made me better and I can prove that now because when I was eight or nine I
think my rating was around 1500 now I've been playing Blitz I play
three minute chess online for 20 years ever since I was a child and my rating
is 1,700 I've gotten no better in 20 years because I don't watch my games back I don't analyze them I don't look
where I made mistakes I just play that's the problem so when people speak they
just speak they don't watch themselves back I'm going to watch this podcast 10 times and I'm identify every single time
I stuttered or made a mistake or didn't use the word I should have used and then people are going to ask me how do I
speak the way I speak why do my podcast get the most views because I'm a professional I'm not going to do something I'm G to do it
properly that's why most people will do a podcast and they'll just sit there and they'll just talk [ __ ] and then they'll
finish it and they'll go on with their broky day and be a broky but it's very interesting what you said about speech because that also ties
back to my current predicament this is the first time in my adult life I can't
use my superpower because my superpower is talking if you would have put me in
front of someone and give me an hour to convince them that I could rip out their throat with my little finger I guarantee
by the end they'd be afraid we both know I probably couldn't but by the end part of them would
think he's confident I can't talk in court because
I don't speak Romanian it's very weird for me I became acutely aware of my superpower because I'm going through
this process and my lawyer is talking blah blah and I'm like why am I so frustrated with all of this and one day
it dawned on me ah I don't get to talk when I get to talk this is how much of a
superpower speaking is when I get to talk it's fine I could have talked the ocean out of freezing me to death on the
Titanic I could have literally said listen bro my unmatched perspicacity I could
have ran my mouth and I would have you know he would have warmed up for me I'm that guy I can't talk now so it's very
frustrating so it's interesting you say how it's a superpower it certainly is because I've even realized it in this current predicament I mean how important
it is to be able to speak when you've lost it because you've lost it like if you lost your hands hands that's right
exactly because I've lost it and the fact there are people going through the world today who want to be successful
and want to have all these amazing things and they only speak English and they communicate in English and they try and get other people to understand their
ideas in English and they can't speak English born to lose born to lose on a
recent live I did I pissed a [ __ ] lot of people off cuz I said the ADHD doesn't exist okay do you think ADHD
exists as a concept or do you think it's something sold to us by big farmer I don't think it exists I agree
with you and I'm G to say there may be some very extreme examples of somebody
who may have ADHD but like everything in the world today now it's been so massively overprescribed that it's lost
all meaning like we talked about rape earlier over accuse loses meaning ADHD
is overprescribed lost all meaning along with basically every mental illness it's over prescribed so it means nothing
anymore I watched a show Once about a kid I don't think he had ADHD maybe he
did or maybe he had autism I don't know what he had something and he had to walk down the stairs in a particular order
skip the first step hop on the Second Step turn backwards walk Three Steps some weird order for his stairs if he
didn't when he got in the car he'd have a temper tantrum and his parents had to take him back in for him to walk the
stairs and I remember sitting with a girl there saying this is garbage that kid needs discipline and the woman said
to me oh maybe has ADHD maybe has allm you don't understand everything you're not a psychiatrist you're not a therapist blah blah blah I turned to her
and said I have never seen an African child who has to walk 10 miles for water doing the walk twice because they missed
a step ever if it was a disease that's exactly
what you'd see you'd see African kids walking backwards and doing a hop and doing the walk twice cuz they miss step
never seems to happen does it so it's not a disease is it it's idiot parents with a spoiled kid and I would argue the
ADHD is pretty much the same in most cases oh he doesn't want to listen he has ADHD no you have no control of your
child that's the first thing the second thing of course he has ADHD when he's
sitting on a tablet playing video games all day and now he has to go to school and read a boring book he's bored at as
I would be of course he is the only thing that's going to keep him doing something that bores him is discipline
and you don't discipline your little kid so no he has about ADHD you're a crap parent how about that I would have loved
I would have loved to tell my father I can't play chess because I have
ADHD I would have loved you the
reaction cuz there were times I didn't want to play chess but but I had to play
chess because I understood that there are some forces of nature which you
cannot argue against when a hurricane comes there's not much you can do and when your father says to play chess
there's not much you can do besides OB unless you want to be destroyed so I understood I would have loved to see his
reaction dad I have ADHD teacher says I have ADHD bro I don't know if I'd be
sitting here alive but I was raised in a disciplinarian household and I would
love for my children to try that crap with me try it I guarantee my kids will
not have ADHD I'll say it here on camera I won't I won't allow them to I won't allow them to now I'm like I said I'm
sure there's extreme examples but I think most of it is just overdiagnosed lack of discipline like everything else
in the world thyroid No overdiagnosed Lack of discipline that's all it is
depression No overdiagnose Lack of discipline dis discipline will fix your
thyroid issue because you'll stop shoving cake down your face and discipline will fix your depression
because you'll become such a monumentally successful person you're not depressed anymore and it'll fix your ADHD because you do what you're supposed
to do not because you want to do it not because you're motivated to do it but because you have to do it so you're going to do it that's how it works
that's all it is we lack discipline in the world today and there are certain Nations where they don't lack discipline and for some reason all of these
illnesses don't exist they're an illness why are they not Universal Across The Human Condition why could the kid in
China go to school and listen in school but the kids in America can't if it's a
disease genuine question to all the psychiatrists are making a bunch of money and big Pharma who are making a bunch of money someone answer me why can
the Chinese kids listen to the teacher and why can't the American kids listen to the teacher if it's a disease
that comes out of nowhere I'll tell you why could get your ass whooped in one place and another you
won't I remember I love my father with all my heart but I remember his faite
his favorite saying was so brutally simple used to frustrate me when I was young but it was true I don't negotiate with
children done can I have this candy no why I don't negotiate with
children and if I asked again I got my ass kicked that was it now I'm a full grown man I think yeah I don't negot
imagine me negotiating with a kid top jeans a child here if you're good if
you're good today and you don't make a mess I'll give you some candy I have to do a business deal with a
six-year-old I'm do a business deal with a toddler like a dummy if you want to
sleep in a house and you want to eat food you're going to do as I say because I raise you and people can come along
and call me all these names BL what how he does his bad all I'm talking about is the basic discipline that everyone had
only 20 years ago we built the pyramids we went to the moon we built New York City and Mumbai and Tokyo and conquered
the entire world with discipline we did fine the the kids became adults and
everything was okay telling a kid it's not in charge of you does not damage the
kid this new world thing is that the kid's in charge of the parent well the kid feels and the kid thinks the kid is
six I don't give a [ __ ] what the kid feels and think the kid is
six I am 37 I am smarter so no and I do not
negotiate with children they will obey me blindly and you know what some
liberal idiot is going to take this clip and I'm going to put it on Twitter and say Andrew's abusive to his
kid and then you'll just get bigger that'll get bigger like a dummy and I
cannot wait because the world is cyclical God is just for the day to come
when their little loser Offspring with their huge list of mental illnesses is failing in life in 30 years from now and
little Andrew Tate is driving his Bugatti one of 10 and his their little loser Offspring get
to look at my winner Offspring and perhaps if I'm still alive and that liberal idiot is still alive I can inbox
them on Twitter and say you failed as a bar told you and I'm Petty enough to do that so
well how many kids you have it's
confidential but if the the amount you say is not putting any of them in any risk is
it depends what if they want annihilate my entire bloodline well but the more
kids you have the harder that is for them correct and if they don't know how many there are it's even harder is it more
than
five it's more than five is it more than 10 I can't give you
any more information than that I'm afraid yeah well I respect that but I've still got to do my job I it's fine yeah
it's fine but yeah you know because perhaps after they assassinate me they
might go for the future saviors of Earth it's like John Connor is that why you're having so many kids cuz the bloodline
the Tate Sur this is an interesting conversation let's let's we might
disagree on this one I think it's the masculine imperative to have as many kids as
possible and I think the only reason men don't have a bunch of kids with a bunch of women is because they're afraid of their woman getting mad at them and yelling at them I think that men if you
were to be honest with yourselves in the mirror you would say I want a bunch of
kids with a bunch of beautiful women but they don't because they meet one woman who they love which is fine and they
know that they have more than one woman to have kids from they have kids outside of their marriage is going to upset
their wife which is fine I'm not hating on them I'm saying that it's not what they want they're allowing the woman's
feelings to Trump their biological imperative which again is
fine but then you have to sit and think is my bloodline and my biological
imperative and my Offspring and my Dynasty less important than the feelings
of a crying woman why pay her bills anyway I don't know is it but in a
thousand years your bloodline will be gone or in a million years your bloodline will be gone or disagree in a
100 million years your bloodline will be gone takes will always exist into attorney masters of iida and I will make
sure that is true so as a man you have to weigh up you have to sit say Okay I
want as many children as possible from beautiful women because I want to recreate as much as possible because
that is my masculine imperative however it's going to upset the woman who I love so I'm going to allow her feelings to be
more important than my Dynasty I understand why most men make that decision but then you have to sit
and say well perhaps if you're in a situation where you're a billionaire and you can financially take care of all these children and all these families
and then perhaps if you believe that you're going to raise the children to resist the Matrix and they're going to
be future Freedom Fighters perhaps you having as many as possible is even more important perhaps now it's actually
imperative that it is more important than the female's feelings even if the woman has a mental breakdown even if she cries her eyes out even if she says why
do you have kids with all those chicks why is she pregnant again I have to save the world so do you
okay so I get that so the the wives and the girlfriends do do they all know this is
what you're doing well they're watching this
Love You No it's
it's I'm I'm talking hypothetically no you know I am know I'm
saying would I be a man in my heart if I allowed a woman's feelings to try to to
Trump my biological incentives and my ability to save Humanity into the future
and my Dynasty and my bloodline because one woman whose bills I pay is going to
get sad about it what is The Logical decision as a man baby it's okay you're
my favorite yeah she has a kid but you're my favorite here's a
benley you know the problem is this is basically all women's fault because women are
slow if men grew babies it would take two weeks 9 months to make a single
baby and you're worried about me having them with someone else well if you would got if you get it done if you gave me
one a week we'd be fine that's 52 a year that's enough if you're going to tell me that across five years the best I'm
going to get is three little babies sounds a skill
is are you get to fight Jag Paul nah come on it would be interesting it
should have happened three or four years ago when I first called him out but I have other fights going on unfortunately
okay so let's say you could get out of Romania and there's a logistical way you could fight Jake Paul would you fight
Jake Paul or Logan Paul or Jake and Logan you
and Tristan I take Jake and loog same night you know what it's kind of you
must be cont tempted but then temp tempted for what I don't need money I don't need Fame I'm the
aside I'm more famous than them I'm more I'm richer than them Jake's actually a nice guy I have nothing against Jake I don't know Logan I spoke to
Jake I know this gonna sound crazy my credentials are based on my
physical capability and they exist up till about three or four years ago because I did a video calling out Jake
Paul three or four years ago up to about three or four years ago I still walked around on the street by
myself and I knew that I could deal with 99% of problems myself but then
something changed and I'm not sure what it was I don't know if I'm getting old I don't know what it was but now I I kind
of see fighting as below me and I'm glad I did it and
it's a huge part of my personality and I'm glad I can still do it make no mistakes I can still do it but now I
think I mean now I don't go anywhere without five armed Goons I just feel like I don't need toat my
I'm a billionaire now my hands are clean and just shoot it just you know I can't
explain something's changed mentally it's like the mafia mentality is changed I've gone from the Hitman to the guy who
calls the hits that's how I feel and every time people mention this fight
they say you can make $10 million and I just think 10 bro I made that yesterday I didn't get
out of bed 10 million to train it's two of your cars bro it's it's pennies to me it's not worth it but I think you could
make a lot more than that though yeah of course I could and I'd spark them but I feel like it gives it gives them more credibility than it gives me and yeah
but didn't you say earlier you know you like to be able to do what other people can't so wouldn't there just be some pleasure in it superiority of course but
when you've had 80s something fights I mean it's not like I haven't done there been there done it it's listen it's not
completely off the table but as things currently stand with my Matrix attack the fact I'm going to end up back in
jail the fact that I want my car COL ction back I want my money back like this is another I've about three or four
years of legal battles to worry about and then by then I'll be what 42 I think just the Divine timing wasn't
right if it wasn't for this Matrix attack 100% it would have happened I think I think it would have happened this year but the Matrix attack came and
it is what it is but I T to against Jake Jake's a really nice guy Logan I don't know Logan he he spoke sh but he's just
jealous I'm more relevant than him in this life so Jordan p P called you
reprehensible and only L wait stop wait wait my heart is broken please only
losers love Andrew T oh my heart is broken no not Jord not not Jordan
Peterson never cleaning my room again give a [ __ ] who cares you know
what I don't watch any you know what I find really great these nerds both
conservatives and liberal Alik because they're all nerds they make videos try to like take me down and I think it's so
funny imagine spending four hours editing a video put I don't watch it I'm busy I don't
know what they say and I don't care and I don't watch it I have no idea what they say I
don't cool the enemy of my enemy is my friend I have nothing against Jordan I'm not
emotional about these things I literally I genuinely have nothing against Jordan I could sit and argue with Jordan I could enter the cage and beat the [ __ ]
out of him or I could shake his hand and be his best friend whatever he wants I don't care what do
you want to do friend hi Jordan you want to fight to the death or do you want to speak on the same stage on the same side
or do you want to debate or what do you want I'm not emotional about this like it's no big deal to
me could a a good thorough debate between you two be something that would
be a I think it would be boring challenge I think it would be boring because I think we agree on most things right I think we agree on everything and
I don't think there'd be a debate because we don't actually disagree the only disagreement is I think and again
this is as someone who's watched very little of his work but I see Clips Etc he's very intelligent and speaks from a
philosophical thought point of view I think he's very in his mind there's a lot of thinking and I am very
action-based and there's a lot of action I feel like if there's a problem his answer will be to think certain ways
and my answer will be to do certain things I always believe in action over everything I don't believe in stopping and thinking and reading a book from a
psychi iist and pondering why I decided to [ __ ] that girl go out get chicks boom get to it so
I feel like he's far more thought based I'm far more action-based perhaps we could argue about the methods towards success for that reason but all in all I
think we agree on most things the only thing I've ever genuinely disagreed with him about was his tweet on Israel and
Ben Shapiro I don't know how he reaches the keyboard he must have a he's down here somewhere in his booster seat he's
typing yeah go to war go to war yeah go to war but
uh he's such a nerd both of them both of them were were the things they said about Israel I thought were were
reprehensible that's the only time Jordan said anything I truly disagreed with do I
think I'm gonna let him off here do I think he's evil no I think he just
emotionally reacted to a situation without thinking and I think he understands how it looks and he regrets
it and we all make mistakes so I don't hold it against him but I have nothing against Jordan Peterson I think if you listen to Jordan Peterson you're going
to be a better person overall he probably dislikes me and I understand why he dislikes me he dislikes me
because he thinks oh Andrew is a pimp blah blah you know what's funny we're talking about this whole pimp
thing I'm from a Luton Council estate my neighbor's house got raided
for drugs like four times right people around me were stabbed to death the cars
in the car par of my school the teachers cars were set on fire most of the people
I went to school with are in jail or sold drugs or murdered people I am from
the lowest Echelon of society in the UK before that I grew up in Gary Indiana
the murder capital of America my mother and father split up I moved to England on my own single mother household raised
on the council state everyone watches top boy everyone watches these shows where people from this socioeconomic
back background sell drugs everyone gets it it's fine when you're from the bomom you have to find a way out the way I
found out the way I found I didn't kill grandmas didn't rob houses didn't break
into cars didn't sell drugs didn't do any of the horrible things that everyone does every single day what did I do was
Drive traffic to web pages for girls who were already doing only fans and webcam
work like a dork like a nerd I found a technical way to drive traffic to web pages and escaped the
ghetto without mugging anybody without grabbing anyone up and putting a knife
to their throat nothing then these morally pure white picket fenced middle
class conservatives who grew up in a household where there was always food on
the table who've never seen struggle sit and say he's a bad person if you're from
the streets you'd understand I've done nothing compared to what I could have done and the fact that they attack me
for it shows how detached they are from reality and that is why they'll never
have the fan base I have because I can speak to the people at the top and the bottom if you're going to sit there
being raised in a happy middle class household with food on the table and two Christian parents who love each other
very much getting read little Bedtime Stories and then you want to sit and tell people from the streets they
shouldn't ever drive traffic to a website to escape the ghetto then you sound like an idiot
dig what had to do to get out Jay-Z sold crack to get out now he's a rapper who
holds that against him it's worse than driving traffic to a website I would argue nobody they're just jealous of my
Monumental success but there's no light without dark the reason I'm monumentally successful is because I had to go through those times that's why they
dislike me that's why Jordan says Andrew is reprehensible I'm just going to tell you
I could sit here and and I think you probably could as well there's always somethingone for me to make fun of friend give me a name give
me a name nah but um let's do some quick fire sure um okay what shocks you about
your rise to infamy I wouldn't say anything shocked
me about it that's a very good question am I arrogant to think it was
always going to happen and I deserve it no I deserve it because I'm so but I
deserve it because I'm brave enough to help other people I think God gave it to me because I'm here to help other people I genuinely believe God gave it to me so
that I could run tap pledge.com and feed Starving Children help people escape the matrix before the hole in the cloud
saves dis closes save people from depression by explaining to them that nobody cares I believe I have a purpose
I believe that's why it was given to me I think it's interesting now that I feel like Fame has changed I
don't feel like there's very many famous people in anymore you know in the 90s or the 80s Hulk Hogan was famous Hulk Hogan
he was everywhere yeah Michael Jackson Michael Jackson everywhere I feel like
maybe I'm one of the last true superstars on Earth I I look at I think who's as famous as me and I can't think
of anyone like you can name a rapper and I guarantee if that rapper walked down the street in Mumbai or Bucharest
or Tokyo he'd get approached less than me maybe in America he might be known
but like Global World Fame I can't go anywhere I can't go anywhere without being swarmed anywhere I was in Slovenia
when that video was made with the thousands of people around the buetti I can't go anywhere I don't know if anyone's even famous
anymore but I feel like I've only got it to try and help people I think that's what I have to do that's why I have to tell the
truth I'm not shocked by how I've been attacked for it I guess the true answer is I'm shocked I'm still here I'm
shocked they haven't got rid of me yet I am shocked by that if you were to ask me before I was famous how long can you be
famous and really tell the truth I would have said cuz I'm a professional I would said how famous the most famous man in
the world tell the truth to who to everybody especially the military age males the number one demographic they
need to sigh off to die in Army and to work their ass off as the backbone of the slave Force while having no
rights I would have said a couple months there's no way they're going to let me they're going to let you for years just
talk and wake up people's minds once they're awake they ain't going back and they would have said how do you
get rid of him I probably would have said will you delete him from everything what if he doesn't get deleted will you put him in jail what if he gets out of jail and then you kill him I'm surprised
I'm still here surprised we're filming it's been years now everything's a lie
it's all a lie don't believe it everything they tell you is a lie
money doesn't work the way they tell you it works school doesn't work the way they tell you it works the things they
tell you to do to get rich like get a mortgage and just pay that off after you pay off for your student debts it's never going to make you rich everything
about geopolitics is a lie we don't need to kill all the people in Yemen for no reason it's all a lie it's all an attack
on your masculinity it's all a lie they haven't killed me
yet how do you show love to
who to a girlfriend to my brother to my children how to to the world to myself yeah I have to
say I thought that was a good question it was you're proving that yours was a better one I'm just a professional sir
and I like to have specifics to work with yeah sometimes or you do an hour's
Ram I can start I start ranting if you like but then I'll just go through them all one by one no I didn't think it in
that context and I'm going to not not girlfriends not brother um
How do you show love
to friends and family I think you show love through no
no no how do you okay I show love to friends and family by being brutally competent I think a man who is not
useful isn't ever going to be loved and I think you have to give love to receive
love for me to love someone I want them to love me for them to love me I have to be useful as a man I think men that are
not useful are not loved by anybody whether it's their girlfriend or Society or other men if I had a brother and I
said to him I need help with this and he said Doo can't tired well thing what's the point of you if you if a girl if a
wife asked her husband to fix a problem and he goes D know can't tired she wouldn't love him anymore useless men
men who are not useful are not loved as a man you're never truly loved for who you are you're loveed for how useful you
are and and they'll lie to you about this especially women I'd love you even if you were a useless loser ER then why
aren't you with a useless loser you always seem to be with the winner isn't that
funny your love for how useful you are so if I want to show love to my friends
and family I want them to love me which means I have to be ultimately useful that's how I show love and is that how
you show love to women I yeah I'm the guy people call when they have a problem
if you end up with one phone call whether you're kidnapped arrested trapped under Rubble whatever it is and
you can call one person you call Andrew Tate if you have my number if you're fortunate enough you call me I'm the
problem solver they love me I'd love people who could fix all my problems if I had a number I could call to get rid
of this Matrix attack I'd love that guy too of course I fix everyone's issues if
you need $10 million you call me so for that reason I'm loved and the way I can
show love to them is always being able to fix their problems if you're a man and you love the people around you you
better get as strong and Rich and competent as possible to show show it if you're a weak useless man how can you
even show love hugs you're weak and uses they don't want your hugs you're
slimy if you're a man and you want to show love to people you need to show it through competence I don't know how a
man who has no Constitution about him can even show
love because that's how love is shown love is shown via protection physical
protection which can be helping them make the right decisions which comes from wisdom Finance you show
Love by giving them money so they're protected my woman will not have to wait at a bus stop where she could be attacked she'll get picked up by armed
guards in a Rolls-Royce all that requires my competence to show love if I was
incompetent how could I even show love hold hands hug problem with that is do you hug
people of course but the problem is with a hug from a guy without competence isn't scarce it's not rare it's needy
well it's I want your energy out of you and it's easy to find and it's only the scarcity
of something that gives it value if you're a normal dude the biggest problem you have is that your woman's clearly
Finding Normal dudes means you better watch out when she goes to order a KFC bucket because she's gonna order from a
normal dude you might give her a smile not as cheesy as [ __ ] extra little
extra little packet of ketchup before you know she's on her
back I don't have to worry about that it's I don't have to worry about that because there's no one on my Echelon my
woman can we my woman can go through life for the next 20 years interacting
with dudes shopping malls whatever whatever and it's just like you're not Andrew you're not Andrew you're not Andrew you're not Andrew you're not there's no one else up here up the top
of mountain so but I show love to her by being that
guy so if you're a man and you want to show love to the people around you you need to get up and become important and strong and Rich and if you don't have
the motivation to do that then you don't even love the people around you you don't love your yourself or anyone else that's how I show love I show love
to the people who I care about by always being the person who can help them when they need which means I need to get up and train I need to get up and work I
need to make a bunch more money more connections more important friends more houses more everything that's how you
show love as a man I don't see how useless men even show love I can't I
can't think of a way now as a thought experiment if I was a useless man how would I show
love and there's no possible way you can flutter with messages that's what useless men usually do flutter with
messages flutter with time but your time has no value so it doesn't matter if I give you
a 10 million useless pesos they're useless this is what a lot of men don't
understand it's kind of interesting when you become Ultra important your time is
Super valuable so my time is I know England hates me but you know what the
British pound sterling is still the best looking money my time's the British pound sterling
one pound if I give her an hour a month it has value but if you're Zimbabwe in
dollars or whatever they had it's inv Bon pounds I think it was pounds your currency is completely valous you can
give her a million hours it doesn't mean anything because you're not important this is what unimportant men don't understand they're like I text you all
the time I send you flowers I message you I hug you I flood your phone I tell you how much I love you and you just left me for that guy he doesn't even
reply because his one reply is worth a million hours of your replies because you're a nobody so even your attention
has no value when you're useless and you have nothing else to give so what can how can you show love
as a man if you don't have competence I can't even think of how you can show it that would be actually a terrible
existence to love people and not be able to show it but if you truly love them you wouldn't stay useless and maybe you don't love
anyone maybe you're just an empty shell for the Matrix maybe you're a slave part the AI machine time to get get your QR
code stamped on your forehead interesting if you love anybody or anything you're going to become
important even if you love your town you'll learn to fight you love your city you'll join your army whatever Love Is
The botom Love is the driver for all masculine achievement and competence
love so I'm a man full of love by extension my brutal competence
is nothing other than proof of how love filled I
am what's a story you've never told or a secret you've never shared
I got robbed in Moscow don't think I've ever told this story have I ever told this one let me think don't think so I
got robbed in Moscow so when was it what happened and I like Russia and I like
Russians but this the first time I went to Moscow three years ago four years ago so do I tell this story yeah all
right everything starts with women doesn't it man they're such an attack Vector so I'm talking to this chick on
Instagram BL blah blah blah I'm ignoring her she keeps messaging me all the time

baddies from Russia start messaging me and everyone wants me to go to Russia like why do all these hot girls want me to go to Russia everyone wants me go to Russia

work then the football game came there was some football thing I think it was a FIFA I don't know football Euro game
something it was in Moscow and if you bought a ticket you instantly got a visa to go to Russia so I was like this is

Korea or something it was like six EUR this ticket to this game it's like a six
Euro Russian visa with no work okay but I'm going to be on my game

a yellow vest goes taxi taxi I like yeah taxi I go to get in taxi and he starts walking towards the civilian car park
and this has happened to me a lot of times in Eastern Europe it happened to me in mdova even in Romania happens sometimes people pretend to be taxis but
they're not taxis and they try to take to their car I'm like no no I want an official taxi not get in your car I have
a taxi I was like no no no no been around goodbye turn around start walking back to the taxis him and his yest runs

messy so he gets out he opens the trunk ushers me to put my bag in the trunk put my bag in the trunk close the trunk get
in the back of the car car starts driving down the right way in Russia and he has his phone as the meter which is
the first suspicious thing and his phone is up there and this and this this number Russian rubles is going through

phone out and I turn on the data I get my text message hi data is 25 pounds a megabyte and like cool whatever how much
is the Russian rubble and I worked out I've been in this car for 4 minutes and I owe $600 in taxi so there's no way

so this big man's driving the car and I've tapped him on the shoulder saying you're trying to rob me I like bro you're trying to rob me stop the car and
he's just like just totally ignoring me driving the car so I'm
like what I don't want to hit him but I guess I kind of had to so I shoved him
so the car moved a bit and said stop the [ __ ] car I'm not paying this I don't have the money I don't have the money
bro I've been around long enough I know a killer when I see one and he turned around and looked me dead in the eye
this man's kill someone I swear to God cuz I have that look so I know when I see it takes one to know one he looks me
dead in the eye looks back gets the phone dials a number hands me the phone
because you guess he doesn't speak English the phone say hello it's the first guy who tried to take me to the
car he goes you wanted a taxi I was like bro I don't even have this money on me
so I don't know what you expect to happen because I don't have this money on me because you wanted a taxi pay the fair
I said bro I can't pay it I don't have it tell him to stop at the nearest gas station I'll give him the money I have on me and I'll get a real
taxi hold up didn't even answer me just hung up with me so like what can I do
here if I hit this guy I guess the car crashes this other guy isn't answering
they want money I no longer have so I tapped the guy and I said okay okay okay I'll pay it call your friend again call
your friend get me the phone again I was like listen I had like I think I had like $44,000 on me I said look I have
$500 is all I have I'll pay the $500 when we get to the end if you let me out
go goes no you paid the miror hung up again like you [ __ ] C unbelievable so I thought it would be
smart so I emailed because my phone call wasn't working so I emailed the kinsky and said I'm having a problem with the
taxi can someone be waiting for me outside the kinsky hotel it's urgent please as a I emailed their info kinsky
do Russia as a complete random and I thought they'd never reply in time they they replied instantly in 20 seconds yes
sir someone be waiting for you no problem so I like ah thank God they replied to that fast great the coner can
argue the taxi drive work all this out so now I'm just relaxing I'm kind of chill a bit and I just had to PR the guy
I was like do you speak English then totally IGN me I was like you're
friendly so I'm just talking so anyway we pull up at the hotel I'm all confident right guy's gonna be outside
pull up at the hotel nobody's outside nobody no no con nothing so I said to the guy I
go to get out the car I get out the car the guy then gets out the car it's comes and he stands face to face with me like
a boxing stare off and shows me the phone of how much I owe him must by now
must I don't know what is a r was $3,000 American dollar something ridiculous I said bro I don't have it he looks at me
like he's going to murder me I don't have it I said I have $500 that's all I have he goes okay using my ninja fingers
my hands I reach in my pocket and I ninja off like 500s because I've got a pile of money like this so I'm
like I give it to him and then the takes the money go and I'm I'm
standing at the back of the car waiting for him to open the trunk gets in the car and starts driving down the road I'm
like bro bro my bag my bag my bag he stops like 5 meters later and goes the rest of the money
he knew they set me up when I put my bag in the trunk at the beginning and my bag's got my laptop my all my clothes
everything which is worth thousands and thousands of dollars now if you're ever getting a taxi you don't put your bag in the boot it was a
setup I was like you [ __ ] I like call your friend so he calls his friend I said listen I've already given him $500
it's very clever what you did with the bag like the guy from the cinsky is about to come out now I can't give you
more than this we have to come up to something sensible said I can go to a cash point and try and get some more
money but I need my bag and he goes okay 500 more said fine I not the phone
instantly peeled off 500 didn't bother going to a cash point and then guy gets back out the car and me and him have a Mexican standoff at the back of the car
he opens up the boot go he he grabs my bag I've got the money we kind of swap
him just after we've done that after I paid this [ __ ] $1,000 the guy from the kinsky walks out oh Mr T you need need
help like yeah help yeah carry my bag you're useless it's been 10 minutes where have you been well sorry Mr Tate
useless it's kind of funny because for the my other four days in Moscow I had a great time I love the Russian people
they're very nice I guess I was unlucky but every time I left the hotel there was like a row of taxis and they all
looked like this guy and they'd all stare at me and I thought I'm so glad I
paid him because I guarantee if I got in a fight with that guy I'd be dead by now they're just waiting outside the kinsky these dudes and the lesson is never put
your bag in the back of a taxi that's the lesson for everybody and that's the story and I survived and I had a great time in Moscow but I'm not going to lie
it did sour things a little bit for me I was a bit nervous on edge and that's how I paid $1,000 for a taxi turns out the
official rate which I found out on the way back to the airport which was booked from the hotel I think it was like six bucks you go I got wrecked but to lose
my bag and my luggage was worth so much more well and surely the $1,000 the lesson was worth more than $1,000 yeah I
mean I like to look in the eyes of killers there's not many people like that around anymore in the west so kind
of enjoyed it in a way I mean Russia's Russia in the west you don't see that look very often but um it was a stark
reminder of the realities of this world because the realities of the world always boil down to
violence and I understand that very well and sometimes you get a little bit comfortable there are people who walk
around through Earth they're walking around we're looking I can look outside right now there's people walking around and they don't understand that every single thing they rely on and everything
they love is backed by violence it always has been it always will be the whole under pinning of a civilized
society is violence the only reason we don't need violence is because there is a threat of violence and you can nail it
down to any law and regulation as simple as a parking ticket if you don't pay your parking ticket they will give you a
fine and if you don't pay the fine they will take you to court if you don't go to court they will take your house and if you don't give them your house police
will come kick the [ __ ] you throw you in jail it ends in violence in all things and it was a good reminder to understand
that making a mistake putting my bag in the back of a car in a in the boot as opposed to keeping it on
me brought me this close to a physical confrontation with probably a Mongolian wrestling champion in the middle of a
street in Moscow by myself and it's a good reminder that violence is always so
close it's only a few steps away at all times and and and the reminder that if
you have enough money you can buy yourself out of death well yeah cuz if you hadn't had a th 5,000 or been rich I
would have been in a lot of trouble yeah you could have been dead I think so and it was good also to to see that I felt
nerves but they were the same nerves I felt before I fall I didn't feel fear which was a good reminder as well to
know that I'm still not afraid I get I get nerves because the nerves sharpened me I don't feel fear which was a good
thing but uh I still remember his eyes you I don't think I've ever been looked at like that in the west and that's
another thing that we can tie back into our whole conversation we just had about how certain societies still operate in a certain way in our Western societies are
so failed maybe I should have told him about LGBT and feminism he might let me go maybe I should have said this is this
is bad this is misogynist maybe I should have just talk some garbage and he would have let me off or is the brutal reality
of the world men who are prepared to die for an idea and his idea was I owed him $6,000 and he was ready to kick sh out
me for it and that's the bottom line of all ideas which we can also tie back into what's very
interesting all these ideals which are against men are defended by
men think about it if feminists go to a feminist rally and anyone tries to
interrupt that rally who comes to stop you men policemen defend the idea which
is designed to destroy them do you remember when America left the Taliban
the America sorry America left Afghanistan and the Taliban took over like a day I was having a debate with
some feminist and she was talking about how terrible Afghanistan is going to be because the women can't go to school
anymore and women need to go to school because they're equal to men and blah blah blah and I saying yeah well I think women should go to school I'm not saying
women shouldn't go to school but I'll will argue that in certain Realms women are not equal to men she goes why so
well you just proved it the American Army left the afghanistani Defense Force
the ADF was left def to defend the girls schools the Taliban started coming
imagine that you've been hired into the ADF you get paid $225 a month you're
given a gun you're some guy guard this girl school girls really need to go to school school fine stand there America
abandoned you you no longer have air support you no longer have night vision they're gone tban are gearing up you see
the dust of the Humvees in the distance the pickup trucks and they're coming you're stand there like do I want to
defend this girl's school n and they bounced fair enough so
I said to her why don't the women defend the school no why should the women do it
you just told me you're equal to men well no not that oh so so the men have to die so you can go to school feminist
I mean I'm just trying to understand I'm not attacking your ideals I'm understanding you believe women are equal to men until it comes to defending
an idea then men have to defend your idea which means men are the only ones who allow you to have the idea in the
first place because if we don't defend it it doesn't exist which means we own feminism it's
ours thanks so much for strong and independent it's men it's all ours so in
the realities of the world all this garbage Falls away anyway because the reality of the world is if you're not
prepared to die to defend an idea you don't have an idea you're not allowed one that's the bottom line and that's
what's so scary about all these ideals which designed to attack masculinity is that the last masculine men which exist defend
it last question
sure is happiness the purpose of life and if it isn't what is okay the purpose of life from a
boring answer is to procreate as much as possible I believe a man should have as many children as possible to further expand I do not believe happiness is the
importance is the purpose of life for a man I believe happiness is what children should strive for and I believe women
should aim to be happy I believe happiness is for women and children I believe men should have a sense of
purpose I believe you should live for something if you live for happiness then
you're hedonistic you go to festivals you do drugs you drink alcohol you're an idiot living for happiness as a man
makes you an idiot 99% of the time if you live for happiness as a woman you
probably want to have a good relationship with your spouse and you want to be Giddy and you want to laugh and joke and raise your children and make pretty things and it's it's pretty
good but male happiness is is just being an idiot I think you need a sense of purpose as a man I think you need to
have something to live and to die for if you feel purposeful you'll never feel feel sad you may be stressed and you may
be busy but you'll never feel sad and I think your purpose can make you happy but I don't think men should be chasing
happiness they should be chasing purpose I wouldn't describe myself as a happy person I don't wake up and go yeah I'm
not two I'm I mean my my chick's
happy yay Italy yay private jet wow this p is great yay Ferrari I'm just kind of
like give me the food I'm hungry whatever ever she's happy that's her job that's why she's around me she's to
happiness women bring the Vibes men bring the money she's happy good I want her to be happy I would hate to be with
a miserable woman but I think men being happy is kind of infantile maybe I'm I would hate to be
with a miserable woman but I would like to actually ask women would you want to be with a happy
man I think women love me because of my competence and because of what I can do but imagine being with a happy man imag
I don't know I'm I'm just speaking you're a woman and your man is happy I
love coffee this is great have you ever had this
WOW fck doesn't gay mean happy I don't know
I'm just talking I don't think I'm supposed to be happy I have things to do important things stressful things I have
things to do I'm supposed to be competent and purposeful and I'm supposed to attack the Matrix and tell the truth and know iido and make
murderers apologize to me in jail and survive the Mongolian wrestler who wanted to kill me and I'm supposed to do
all of that I don't know at what point I'm supposed to be smiling like a child my children are supposed to be happy the
women around me are supposed to be happy but that's not my job or my purpose I think the men who want to be happy are
losers and I think if I think that would actually be a turnoff for most women I think if you were to if a if a man were
to say to a woman I just want to be happy and don't want to have any stress you know I just want to be happy I think a woman deep in her heart would be like
what what me to be happy pay my bills I don't think she wants that either
so if your base purpose is to recreate and being happy I'm not saying
be miserable at all I think people understand what I'm saying here and being happy for the sake of Happiness
itself repels females then I don't think happiness is the purpose of life as a man no you're
supposed to be important was gask Khan happy you wouldn't have thought it's F
Well I wouldn't I wouldn't describe him as happy he'd be described as a lot of things before happy you'd say he's
competent youd say he's successful youd say he's ruthless you'd say he's smart
you say he was a tactical genius you'd say lots of things before you ever got to happy if you ever got there do we
remember the happy men of history what and
plus I mean p if you're purposeful it's lasting happiness is
fleeting that's the problem which means you're always going to be chasing a higher high you'll be happy and then it
will go away then you want to be happy again then it'll go away you're going to end up just doing dumb [ __ ] how you become a drug addict I took a little bit
of drugs made me happy and now it doesn't work so I could take more drugs and this time I'll be happy chasing happiness is is a spiral to nowhere I
will argue that my largest transformative periods in my life the times when I've done the most amazing things are not when I was happy was when
I was the complete opposite if you were to tell me how do you completely transform your life I'd say they end up
depressed when you're depressed you can transform your life that's when your soul is malleable enough for you to do whatever it requires to go through the
pain that's when you can look a guy in the face and say shoot me then I don't care that's when you're dangerous that's
when you get things done that's when you get rich that's when you become a man that's when you train that's why I miss my
nightmares now I sleep I'm mad at myself I'm disappointed in me I'm like what no
slept four hours no wake up and sweating and panicking that's what I should be
doing I don't want to be happy what I want to be happy for I want to grab Life by the throat and squeeze it I want the
Matrix to lock me up again do it I don't care it's kind of
like you know I I've always liked people who are
very competent but depressed I've known some people who were like depressed and
miserable but they're very competent and I like them because if I hired a happy
person he's only one bad event away from becoming useless like this guy's already at the bottom bro and he's getting
everything done you can't hurt this guy he has nothing to lose I like him give
me more of this guy like hey bro your car just got stolen yeah
probably those are the best I love those guys maybe I put on a happy veneer but
I'm kind of one of them I I expect any minute for police to bust in here and drag me away like told you to who cares
happy people are oh I'm sad I I don't know I don't
think men should be operating in this Paradigm another way I can answer the question is I think
happiness there's a really interesting uh documentary about colors and it was about an African tribe and it was
talking about how colors affect language so in your book this is red and this is blue because we labeled them as such and they
showed this African tribe that had different names for very different shades of green and to them they were
clearly different colors but to us they're just green but this tribe couldn't tell the difference between red and blue because to them it was the same
color so they couldn't see the difference in the Colors by how the language determined how your eyes can
detect colors it was very interesting and I think the same can be for happy if you set the idea of Happy as laughing
like a child in gsh immaturity then you're only going to be happy a couple of times a month truthfully if you're an
adult but if you set the bar of happy as anything over
distraught then you're always happy when you feel true pain in life if your parent were to die your instant reaction
is silence when someone's really hurt they don't talk when you're really depressed you don't talk my first day in jail I didn't speak you don't talk when
bad things happen if you got a phone call and someone said your all your family just died in a car crash you'd freeze you don't talk so if
you set your mind to say if I am speaking I am happy because I'm clearly not distraught
then I'm a happy person most of the time I'm happy 99.9% of the time now because I have decided what happy is but if you
decide I'm Only Happy When I'm laughing like a child and I have no stress at all and nothing's going wrong and I'm at a
festival and my girlfriend's love loves me and well then you're then you're never going to reach it and then you're going to destroy your life trying to
reach it so happiness is also self-prescribed so I think if you're a man and your arms are functioning and
you can speak today because nothing terrible has happened then you should be happy and don't worry don't worry guys
bad things are going to happen they're going to come you have nothing to worry about there will be a day you wake up and somebody you love has died and you
can be sad that day why waste a perfectly good day being sad when sad days are guaranteed to come everyone you
love is going to die everyone don't worry about it sad days are coming for you so I wouldn't have them in advance
if I you I'd wait for a real reason and just smile something to dip that's what I would saying and this
show is called disruptors what does that word mean to you people who break the Paradigm who
attacked the Matrix who disrupt the normal flow of the programming which is
designed to be installed in all of us and I think as much as I understand and say about how people need to break free
I understand that there has to be matrix-m minded people not everybody can break free because Society wouldn't work
we need the people who believe in the garbage and we need the people who follow the programming and we need people who lose so that Winners can win
there's no light without dark but anybody with a brain is capable of having anything they
want in life I believe the universe is very giving and perhaps you will know but I've never met anyone who genuinely
tried their hardest for anything and never got it I've never seen somebody dedicate themselves properly and never
and not get it I've never seen it I've never seen somebody try their best and not get it I've seen people pretend to
try their best and not get it I've seen people say they want it and not get it I've seen people make excuses for why
they'll never have it and not get it but I've never seen anybody who just wakes up shuts up works and not get it ever
you can have anything you want and that's how you disrupt The Matrix because most people are lazy and
stupid so just to tie back into my school when I explain to people for $49
I'll tell you exactly what to do and all you have to do is follow instructions sit there and follow instructions and
you will have everything you've ever desired the car you want the woman you want the house you want the holidays you
want all you have to do is do the work and you can disrupt The Matrix or you can stay lazy you can stay inside the slave programming and there people
there'll be people who always do that and we need them because uh I don't you don't wash
your own cars do you I don't so uh some some 's got to do
it and uh that's how Society functions there's always going to be winners and there's always going to be losers this has been a pleasure thank

would you do just makes me so nervous now all
right cool put you on the spot Andrew hello welcome welcome to the George
jenko show and thank you for ending season season one what a great season what a great season um I brought my
notes bro cuz I didn't want to come all the way to Romania and then like forget so if you see me looking don't get don't yeah it's a long way to come you know
it's kind of the Forgotten part of the world I I'm not Romanian but I certainly put Romania on the map I don't feel like
anyone talked about Romania ever ever and why did you come here I decided to leave the West I can
give you a very happy funny answer do you want Happy funny Andrew or do you want serious the world is ending Andrew
two different versions I want both I want both versions of you sure well I think that the Western world is in
serious Decline and that literally in real time you can see it falling apart so you have to find somewhere else to
live and the world's not really that big I think that the values which held the Western world together are at some point
have been proven to be false and all of it is a lie I feel like all of the metrics in which you can measure the success of a society the Western world
is failing in so once you accept that you say okay the West is failing it's on its way down I can't live in the west
and then you look at a a map and you look at South America which is very dangerous and I'm not South American and
I don't speak Spanish and then Eastern Europe which is where we are now preserves its culture via religion and
they have some other societal what's the word I'm looking for
traditions which certainly preserve the culture better it's a slower decline so I felt like this might be a good place
to live unfortunately I think in the seven years I've been here Eastern Europe is catching up with the west and I feel like it's going to go down the
same hole so I'm going to have to move again but when I moved here 7 years ago it just felt like a safer Place felt
like a nicer place and uh decided to leave I don't see what America or the England or the West has for people
anymore okay question do you think that this generation is more evil than the past Generations that we I don't think
they're evil I think they're lost and I think they're misguided and I think we're now living in a culture where I'm a full- grown man I'm 36 years
old I catch myself even at my ripe old age and high level of professionalism
some times for a few seconds only a few seconds before I correct myself scrolling on garbage imagine how these
14 and 15y old children are even being raised just scrolling through these social media algorithms which are deliberately designed to poison their
mind and they're going to school they're being fed absolute garbage and they have no religious connotations no God and no
family unit they're just a mess and then we look at like I said every metric in which you can measure the health of a
society the crime rate and the cost of living basic things traffic anything you
can measure the West just falling off a cliff so it's like how do you fix all of that so I decided to move to Eastern
Europe and I had a very good time here and I was treated very well and it's a very safe place and it's a beautiful country I've been through some recently
recently things changed a bit I think you get out of your house yeah yeah that's exciting well I'm allowed out my
house yeah that's nice well uh if you don't mind me asking what's the first thing you did when you got out of your house my first day off of house arrest I
stayed in the house that's [ __ ] weird man I know but it was a it was a sign of resistance oh you wanted to prove that
you could keep going yeah that's right I feel like you're flexing all the time like is there like like if I was on house arrest who the [ __ ] you flexing
for just leave and and anything you could have lied and be like no I stay for an extra 3 days but like you you
stayed I stayed just to prove a point was it for your brother or was it for your no I was just joking about the LIE
actually I have it in my notes cuz I know that you don't like lying and I I have a story about lying I was um I'm not going to mention his name out of
respect for him but uh he took me on his jet we were having a great time we were about to do business together we're Courtside um and he made a comment about
one of the basketball players uh he's like he's a little [ __ ] cuz he told his uh teammate was cheating and got him in
a scandal and I said well well the other man was cheating he was lying um and he goes he turns to me he goes if you have
a problem doing business with people that cheat you'll never work and I One stopped immediately wanting to work with
this guy two uh my provider is God nobody else um so it comes with morals
if you're going to cheat on a woman that you're building a life with and being fruitful with what the [ __ ] are you going to do to me well that's very true
true and that's very valid and but I'll play devil Devil's Advocate here what
the other guy said about if you're going to if you have problems doing business with somebody to cheats you're never going to do any business unfortunately
Finding The Right Woman & Andrew's Problem With Monogamy
he's also pretty right because it's it's R but not with Partners though I don't feel like you want to get in business
with a partner I mean think about this he he shares a family Bloodline with the person that he's robbing yeah I'm
nothing to him that's true and that is infallible logic so how can I even for me my my girl right she's partner it I
couldn't focus if I had to come do this interview with you and I know she's out somewhere now I have to think about what
she's doing it's taking away from me so if I'm breaking bread with a man and I'm doing business with him I can't sit around wasting my time thinking about
what he's doing and you're completely right and I I totally understand that but as a honest individual I have to sit
here and be honest and analyze myself and analyze my own romantic
relationships am I completely faithful in the traditional sense no why is is
that it's a good question I'm not I can't say exactly why that is but I I think that probably the
biggest decline in the Western World I have to accept even though I partake in it and even though I am guilty of it I
think the biggest failing of the western world is that men and women do not stick together anymore I think it would fix a lot of problems I find that very
fascinating that you know that's the problem you you teach men to be better men to fix their problems don't run away
from it but you know that monogamy is a challenge for you but you don't want to it's not a challenge monogamy is not a
challenge for you monogamy is a decision that every man must make but for you to make that decision you have to sit down
and decide that you know this woman is worth me being monogamous too which is fine I think the biggest struggle that
men have in the western world today is finding a woman who they believe is worth being monogamous to I don't think men have a problem with monogamy as much
as men have a problem finding a woman who they truly believe they should be monogamous too also that's something
that's interesting about monogamy because we can talk about this and it can be a very interesting conversation in days of old high value men important
Men Kings Warriors whatever had multiple wives and they had to look after the multiple wives or they had Mistresses and they had children with them all and
they had to look after them all in certain cultures today that is still the case in certain religions today that is still the case in the Christian world in
the Western World we have said that's unacceptable we should be monogamous yeah but then you have the majority of
men who are monogamous are cheating the ones who are not cheating are using
prostitutes sometimes or going to strip clubs sometimes or consuming pornography so they're not truly actually loyal so
you've moved the idea of a man having three or four women he loves and taken
care of to a man having one woman he's supposed to love and doing a whole bunch of things in secret you've just
subsidized monogamy and you've removed it all towards pornography and degeneracy so then you have to sit and
argue well why does so much degeneracy happen in the west is it because we are not allowing men to be more true to
their instincts this is all brand new thoughts for me and I'm just speaking as I think but let's look at another
example right oh before can I tap in with that um so what's your example
right so I have an example Christ he gives me his way and I kind of follow it
if I had to follow men and their needs I'd be burned up tomorrow and I don't think it's needs I don't think I don't
think men cheat because of needs I think I I well okay women cheat because of like feelings they get an emotional
attachment to them men cheat because of more lustful body type of thing I've never heard of a man being like man I
can't wait to talk to Becky of course but I think a lot of it's also ego exactly so but ego what comes before ego
or it comes after ego yeah a fall yeah yeah so my thing is yes when I my okay
here's my theory when I was out about and I was having fun as a Christian man I was waiting for the right woman Y and
I came to this guy and he goes I don't understand I thought you were a Christian and I go listen bro I'll be a good Christian man to a good Christian
woman when I find somebody who has good morals and I know that she'll have my back and she'll do good and when God
presents me that girl I will be be a good man to her and he asked me something that changed my life forever
he goes well if you're the Son of God and you're asking for his daughter why would that father ever give you a daughter when you treat everybody else
like garbage and so I have to think I think when it comes to Blessings I believe
that it's given from God Y and to move on to new blessings you have to handle
what you've been given agreed so if I've been given the fame and the money and the access to women God's monitoring me
okay are you going to go fool around act like trash can you be trusted you be trusted with this daughter that I have
over here kind of like that um picture that where Jesus is holding a beautiful bear behind him and then you're holding
on to this lifestyle that you still want but you're like this is great and God's like no no no give it to me show me
you're ready for it and then I'll present it like any good father would be absolutely um and I did I cleaned up my
ACT I was celibate and I and I was showing him I'm trying now to be ready
and then I found the beautiful girl and then I became monogamous and then I have a good partnership and here's the thing
I could lead that relationship anywhere I want if I wanted to be opened it could be there not saying that she's
comfortable with it but when it first started I could plant the seeds into taking it in any direction that I want
correct it takes somebody with um Integrity to lead a woman in the right
direction absolutely I tell people all the time I'm in charge of the relationship God is in charge of everything so when my girl looks at me
to lead the house I got to lead the house but it's not from my needs cuz if it was my needs
bro she's she's out [ __ ] cold that like she's not going to get the best out of it but now I have a god looking at me
and monitoring you got to love her like you love my church no absolutely everything you're saying is completely true and I agree with you there's two
ways we can answer the question we can talk about it from a religious perspective and what you just described and you're right being a God-fearing man is going to lead a woman in the correct
direction because of a woman is the reflection of her man and that's why you see if a woman gets with a bad guy who does drugs she ends up doing drugs and
doing bad things and a man can lead her in the wrong direction she comes from our ribs metaphorically and physically and mentally right so if I'm gonna be
like you're saying doing drugs she's gonna follow my lead absolutely but I'm just talking about it from a societal perspective I'm making an overall
societal observation the fact that now we have monogamous societies but because they're not truly monogamous all of the
desire is being outsourced towards degeneracy as opposed to having a society where a man is allowed more than
one wife for example and then the degeneracy isn't needed you don't need pornography and you don't need prostitution if you're allowed to have
two three four wives if you're successful and the point I was going to make earlier is that in certain countries this is still the case and I'm
just speaking here in generalities I don't have proof for any of this but if you look at Russia right Russia is a
Christian Nation there's a lot of Muslims as well but it's traditionally a Christian Nation but if you're a very rich powerful Russian man and I've been
to Moscow I can assure you you have maybe four or five wives well not wives four or five girls yeah and your wife
understands about who the other girls are and she doesn't really care don't look don't care don't ask I have a Bentley I have a big house I have the
children he plays around with these other girls sometimes I don't care I'm his wife and that's just how things are set up that particular man who's very
very rich he's not interested in pornography he's not interested in prostitutes he's satisfied he has enough for whatever his ego desires or his
heart desires then you look at the west and you look at the most degenerate things which can possibly happen which are actually levels above prostitution
and pornography if you look at Epstein's Island for example when you have very rich powerful men and they're told by the public sphere you are not allowed to
have more than one woman but they don't have God to control them they're Godless then they say okay well how can I
satisfy myself if God's not restricting me the society saying I can only have one woman I'm not allowed to have four
or five which would satisfy me in some regard for my ego or unhealthy reason or whatever my reason is so I'm going to
end up doing things in private I'm going to end up doing things in secret and then you have Epstein's Island appear so it's kind of interesting God is
important and God is extremely required to restrict people but if you take the God out of the element and you only use
Society to try and restrict the sexual desires of people and tell them they have to be monogamous you're going to end up with more degeneracy than if men
were allowed to be poly polyamorous and have more than one wife does that does that make sense 100% And the reason why I asked you is this generation more evil
than the last and I wanted to Circle back how you said the West is falling apart I believe that it's kind of and I
always go back to biblical references not because I'm an annoying Christian but I just like truth and I and I notice that truth comes out of these
testimonies that I see and the one thing that I've realized with Humanity God or no God it's your access Y and I think
that's why God reflects the heart he doesn't reflect your actions he reflects your heart cuz let me give you an
Is P*rnography Corrupting Our Kids?
example pornography don't watch porn the reason why I don't watch porn is one um it's unhealthy I for me before before
you carry on I don't watch porn cuz it's genuinely uninteresting like you could you could put porn on and I'd be
like I I I just don't I don't get it that's the thing and also um for example
I like to practice the monogamous relationship so when I get married one day I know my girlfriend's not going to be at the prime model look when she's 50
or whatever she is so I got to practice that this is the only woman that I have it's diligence corre um okay so opening
up the access look at a man who's watching pornography there was a there okay I I fall off the wagon every once
in a while I'm not sitting here saying that I'm perfect um uh about a year maybe two years ago I I was watching
porn and there was back in the day when I was growing up was like your stepmom and to me that was always weird cuz I'm
like dude that's your like still it's your mom now it's your mom and then when I like freaking like last year when I
tried I did a a a a KSI and sideman um thing where was impulsive inidan we did
this collab and there was a girl who does porn there and I made a joke and I go look I'm stuck and and and it went
viral and I realized I'm like everybody laughed at this joke because they know what I'm saying and it's this porn style
thing where if women are stuck then men would come and have sex with them yeah that's of course it is yeah that's right
yep and these men are enjoying this y so what is this teaching them that you could take what doesn't belong to you
and I think a lot of the things that they're programming these kids to do actually comes first through pornography
because you watch it in secret and you're not really dabbling with your men which you're watching it's it's kind of like a a mustard seed that grows yep but
then the question is are they doing on purpose this is where you go deeper down the rabit hole this video is sponsored by a freaking Beast of a product that I
absolutely love electric ebike now you guys always hear me talking about me riding my electric bikes but there's a

[Music] like me I'll write it right here for you please visit the
website who's doing it on purpose well there you go then you go deeper down the rabbit hole okay let's go so we're look
let's accept pornography is bad for a society let's accept that to be a fact it is true okay pornography is bad for a
society okay why are they trying to destroy this Society who are these people what is their end goal is their end goal the sexualization of children
is their end goal 12-year-olds to sit there and watch pornography and want to have sex is their end goal to confuse 12-year olds to want them to try and
change genders is that their end goal I don't know is that why they take down the the the country's flag and put up another flag this is another thing you
have to to to understand we talk about the Western World being Fallen do you mind moving that mic towards your mouth
we talk about the Western World being Fallen what even is the culture of the western world anymore we have gang signs
and we have frozen food and we have the pride flag what else like what even is
there anymore that unifies Us in any regard I mean I think I I'm pretty sure and I've never tested this I don't want
to find out I'm under enough Matrix attacks but if you were to burn an American flag and burn a pride flag you do more time for burning the pride flag
it's a hate crime so it's you have to actually then understand is okay if this is destroying Society is it being done
on purpose and what is the end goal of it and who's doing it behind who's doing it in the first place and then then then it gets really scary I agree with
everything you're saying about pornography and I agree with everything you're saying about monogamy I'm just trying to analyze the world and how it actually functions and how do you fix
these things and setting examples leading by example my my question to you is this let's label uh this group of
How Andrew Is Going To Beat "The Matrix"
people that you're you're let's just I want to label so we could always Circle back to it what would you like to call them the Matrix The Matrix The Matrix so
the Matrix is uh there do you feel like the Matrix is hyped up using media
because think about it when I walk around and I have discussions with people not a lot of people have the same
agenda that the media is having and I think people are keeping up with it so do you think they're they're flexing
their power let me give you an example God is all powerful all strong the devil isn't but what his power is is lies so
he confuses you God uses Faith the devil uses fear y do you think the Matrix is
just full of [ __ ] and they're just fear-based oh they're absolutely fear-based so what are what what what is
your goal if you had to fight like you are fighting and you're banned from what what are you banned from everything but you're on Twitter uh I'm
I'm Elon bought Twitter and restored me before this I was banned on Twitter also I'm banned on why did you get banned I
got banned because you get three lives and the three lives are first you get canceled and banned absolutely everywhere and the second life is they
try and put you in jail for something you didn't do and then the third life is they assassinate you and I'm now on my second life as most people have
experienced in real time I got banned because I became monumentally popular I became hugely successful I became the
most Googled person on the planet and then they make up a reason to get rid of you and I'm banned on Tik Tok Instagram
YouTube Spotify SoundCloud Uber Airbnb Gmail what you can't get an Uber I can't
get Newber no Gmail WhatsApp you name you name an application for standing up for what you believe in well yeah I mean
I made some satirical jokes of course and did you give me an example of something that you've said that you may have crossed the line I don't think I
ever said anything that truly crossed the line and I'm and I'm going to stand by this because I don't believe in regrets and I don't believe in sitting here and saying sorry for anything cuz
I'm not a coward if I made a video 10 years ago that got 84 YouTube views and
me and my brother were joking about how women can't park and women shouldn't drive and then I became the most Googled man on the planet and then that is found
and then a bunch of feminists get upset by it I'm not going to sit here and beat myself up over that that's life a well
[ __ ] happens but also like stand up comedians make the craziest jokes like I was in a comedy club and they're already making jokes about Palestine of course I
mean comedians make jokes and rappers sing about murdering people so it's it's completely a double standard to come
along and say that whatever I said was enough reason for me to be canceled well that scares me cuz s censorship is the scariest thing to me in in the world at
what point can we not worship Our God my phone I the day the cancellation started
I'd open my phone and app by app one by one logged out logged out logged out
logged out logged out and in sync I was sitting there for two hours and every 20 minutes a new one would just log out were you scared I knew the Matrix was
real I knew how the Matrix operated I knew that there's centralized power I I was scared because I knew I'd used up my
first life and then I started saying on all my podcasts are going to put in jail for something I did not do when that
happens you have to know it's a lie and I said it about 15 times and then 7 months later I ended up in a Cell so I
understand exactly how the world works so yeah I was scared but I also believe and I draw a lot of strength from My
Religion we talk about God I think God gives you strength and I also believe one of the primary objectives of a
religion which ties back into what we were saying earlier about how the world could be fixed if men and women stay together and monogamy I think the
primary objective of a religion is to preserve a culture if a religion doesn't Preserve preserve the culture then it's
failing in some regard you should look at a religion and look at the culture underneath that religion and say okay is
successful religion because the culture is adhering to its Creeds so I understand that is my battle if I
believe in God to try my my best to preserve the culture and then you're asking how do I fight the Matrix I think
you fight that bya masculine empowerment and I'll tell you why because we were just sitting here talking about how the
devil uses fear and you're completely correct and think that women are easier to scare than men and I think that now
we live in a society especially in the west where women have been empowered to the point well I'm not I'm not against female empowerment I'm not misogynist
but they've been empowered to the point where they're more powerful than men in most scenarios they're more powerful than men in the divorce court most
powerful than men in the custody court more powerful than men in terms of the education system more powerful than men
in terms of their testimony more powerful than men I'll give you a endless examples if 10 men get murdered
nobody cares if 10 women get murdered it's going to be a national news story for weeks their life is more valuable and I'm not saying it shouldn't be it
always has been because they can create life my point is we now live in a society which I believe is a matriarchy it's feminized and men are feminized by
extension and men being feminized means that women are in charge and women are fearful so let me give you a very simple
example of why I believe masculine empowerment is how we actually get closer to God and how we fix the the fight we're in against the
Matrix co co was emotional arguments they came along and said your grandma's
going to die the people your grandma your grandma they used em emotional arguments emotional arguments to create
fear that works on a woman a woman sits there I love my grandma most men would sit there and go wait let's just chill
yeah see what happens grandma's already 94 Grandma's die so I don't think we should be taking our kids out of school
let's just calm down men are more stoic and more patient if you had a household where the man's been feminized and the
woman's in charge it's over for that house they're full covid cucks head to toe 10 vac scenes you they are if you
had my household where my girlfriend ran in did you see the news sh shut up this is stupid okay and it's
fix but this is the point fear you're talking about fear the devil using fear absolutely correct how how does he scare
people he scares cowards he scares people who can't fight he scares women he scares people who are not who are not
prepared to stand up and resist so Mass good empowerment is absolutely inly how you battle the devil you need men to be
as strong and capable as possible okay this this is a great great uh uh uh pivot that I want to say everything you
George Confronts Andrew Being "Dismissive" To Women
just said I agreed with everything you just said I agreed with the only problem that I see is when you were like shut up
let me give you an example here's the reason why everything you just said was absolutely correct and as a man I could
look at you and if I had children I'll be like yo listen to this man he's he's being very very correct now my girl is
going to be like well why did he just tell his girl to shut the [ __ ] up like I said shush yes yes but okay let me give an examp I was dismissive with my hand I
know but you know what this means flicking the diamonds get the [ __ ] out of my face like this is what every girl
here shut up and go make me a sandwich this is what this is what comes off so you're fighting getting men to be like
yes but then you turn off the women here's the problem you're trying to make men more men but men before they listen
to you are listening to the girls because they just got a girl they don't want to lose them they did everything
that they could to get this girl so here's the thing when you see a fireman bust into a building that's on fire he's
not going to look at the be like what the [ __ ] why did you do this he's going to be like hey it's okay look at me grab
my hand come out why can't you take that approach I think I am and and it's actually funny when you say I lose to
women because I'll tell you something that most people probably do not know I don't know if I've said it before I have never had
a negative interaction with a female ever since I blew up on the Internet I've not had a single woman complain at
me I'm so sorry could you just use your mic I've never had a single woman come up to me and say anything bad when I was
in jail I had thousands of love letters from women I've never had a single woman complain about anything I say now I
agree this dismissive the the the diamonds you know in the in the light I get it yeah is it purposeful I don't
want to say it's purposeful do I find myself amusing certainly yeah it's hilarious but here's the thing we could
take a joke and we could we could filter the [ __ ] but females like you said they're based off of emotions they're
going to feel their emotions first and then react men are like oh that's [ __ ] hilarious obviously he's not
going to tell this girl to do that most the real scenario like sweetheart come sit down everything's fine listen to me
I'm going to protect you so I'm just curious to know why don't you just take that approach cuz I know you know what
you're doing you're a chess master every move you make you're making it for a reason are you doing it to be polarizing
there's no light without dark and I think that it's actually kind of interesting my my I don't have many
haters anymore for a while I did about a year ago there was a big group of the internet that disliked me now I actually
would argue I'm one of the most liked people on the internet I think people are waking up but bro every single if you read thousands of comments they're
all positive I'm one of the most liked people on the internet and I can give you reasons for why I believe that is but the very few people left to try and
dislike me they they fuel conversation and it's interesting for them to it's interesting for me to hear it's
interesting for there to be debates regarding things I say but I think I I
don't think I try and be polarizing I tried to be abrasive because I grew up in a world where I was hit very hard by
life and I think life is abrasive and I think you learn lessons with a degree of abrasiveness I think if things are too
soft and too well explained you don't learn them I and and you can apply that to nearly anything right you can go driving your car and drive fast and you
can nearly lose the tires 10 times but you're not going to stop driving like an idiot until you hit a tree and then you're going to be like okay I've
learned my lesson yeah so perhaps when I display a point if I have to self-analyze and answer your question as
a professional when I try and get a point across if I can do something or say something which is a bit abrasive I
feel like it teaches better I'll give an example if I say women women aren't very good at parking as opposed to females
have no spatial awareness so it's the same thing but one of them enrages the world in fact both
of them make them mad but the second one really makes them mad don't call women females they hate that I don't yeah I'm
just warning you but but then they upset they actually get upset if you call them a female absolutely I sit on these panel shows with a bunch of women and I'll say
something do you if I'll say what do you respectfully call them females I just call them female no no but if they get
offended by that then what do you call them exactly but this is my point so I can decide how abrasive I want to be you can you can you can say the same thing
in different ways and then you're ask me why am I abrasive to be deliberately polarizing because I feel like it gets my message across better I feel it gets
my message across better and even now the thing I just said which brought this whole point up me saying shh and being
dismissive was a small way of showing a larger meta point and The Meta point was
I'm uninterested in what you're about to say and your fear I'm uninterested in your fear I get this and you somebody
with a logic understands this somebody who's probably grew up with humor understands this somebody who grew up
with a good father understands this so this is my thing God made you a leader
100% I'll take it okay and now you're Leading Men y but there's a huge crowd of people that you will never understand
or touch because I feel pridefully you don't give a [ __ ] you're like if you can't come on with me on this journey
then get the [ __ ] bent literally metaphorically and physically well not all minds are ready to be freed they say
inside of the movie but which one is is valuable enough to be free Christ saved everybody he didn't just come and pick a
couple people absolutely but you can only you can lead a horse to war or you cannot force it to drink and I feel like the reason why I'm now one of the most
Why So Many People Are Following Andrew's Message
liked people on the internet and the reason my comments are so positive I have I have to answer that question is
because I feel like I'm heavily leveraged against chaos the thing is with my brand I don't entertain I do
entertain but that's not my purpose I'm trying to teach people things I'm trying to give them things even the things I
sell are beneficial I have a school that teaches people how to make money online it's beneficial if you follow me you can
make money online you'll start to train and go to the gym you'll listen to some positive motivational things you'll feel
more motivated I'll try and guide you towards God either one I'm not even strictly Islam I believe that if you're
a religious person you're a better person regardless of the religion you choose because you have to follow your morals and have boundaries absolutely so
all of my messaging is positive so as the world gets more messed up I'm leveraged against chaos as the world
becomes a bigger mess as people struggle to survive to pay their bills as people become more and more unhappy as the wars
start all this craziness people sit there and go do I want to be entertained by clowns do I want to watch these
streamers who are clowns do I want to be entertained or do I want a solution do I want some form of stability who is
saying things which can actually help me which actually will directly impact my life in real time and make me feel
better and that's me so I'm not a inter ainer in that way which is why I believe my brand has become so strong and why
most people like me and it's also why a lot of people will forgive me for being semi- abbrasive because I feel like as the world gets more messed up which it
is people are going to learn some very abrasive harsh lessons and sometimes when you've gone through a very harsh
lesson to be given a solution which isn't harsh you're not going to believe it to be given a harsh solution makes
you feel like okay this guy knows exactly what he's talking about I was on a podcast very recently I don't think
it's even come out yet and I was explaining to to somebody talking about depression which everyone asked me about I'm going to circle back to that I have
something in my notes for that yeah and I was saying that as a man your life is supposed to be [ __ ] my argument to this
is people go oh I don't feel good I say good your life as a man is going to be terrible the entire time who told you at
any point I don't know what the Bible says I haven't read it cover to cover like I've read the Quran but I don't think the Bible says you're supposed to
be happy all of the time the Quran certainly doesn't Matthew it says you're supposed to cast your anxiety and
depression on them so life isn't going to be easier but you could go let me an example when Jesus was walking on the
water this is the example I say when a storm hits the storm is still hitting but there's a difference from you
drowning in the storm or standing above the storm absolutely and I think that you're always going to have challenges
and obstacles storms are going to come but I guarantee you there's obstacles that you could walk through with a smile on your face that another man could fall
apart absolutely I've just been through some and I'm sure I'll have more what was
it it says in the Quran just because you believe you think Al will not test you just because you believe in me you think
you're not going to be tested I think being tested is a great thing for you that's how God shows love yeah because
yeah because God's love is a disciplinarian love it's a masculine love it's like a father a father shows love through putting you on the bike
letting you fall over letting you hurt your knee picking you back up putting you back on the bike that's how a father shows love and God is the same your
father used to push you down when you see a kid that's right your mom used to be upset about this let's time travel back to you as a child sure cuz I feel
like what made you who you are now is based mostly off of how you were raised absolutely take me back yeah I think I
had the best possible upbringing a person can have which is good parents and no money I didn't get famous or Rich
Young which I also thank the the Lord for I think a lot of these people who get famous online quite early I think
Who Runs The World, Why Money Isn't Real & Modern Slavery
they miss out a lot of life it's not real life it's not real life it's not real life no I had real jobs and I did
real things and I was really broke and I was really on the bus and really trying to pay rent and doing real stuff for a long time I wrote a line in here and I
think you could relate to it um a poor man is broke a rich man is broken so so
if you're broke you could figure out a way to be rich but if you were given everything and you don't know how to
manage this life you're broken and you you don't feel like you've earned anything I've met more depressed rich
men than I've met depressed broke men it's amazing you say that because there's two answers to that my first one
is I love that you say that because I always say I'm not rich I'm a poor man with a lot of money I always used to say
that and I don't want to brag or anything but just because I get asked this question a lot I've been extremely
successful I've hundreds of millions of dollars in fact I think our last valuation across everything we own was we almost at B now so we're doing very
very yeah I'm a I'm a billionaire top G is a billionaire so we're doing extremely well that's the first thing
the second thing it's actually it's great that you say that because I completely agree because if you're born with everything if you're born with all
this money that you have no aspiration nothing to actually to CRA grasp onto and trying to achieve then money doesn't
make you happy but then you can analyze this from another angle right we were just talking earlier we can always pivot
back to who the Matrix are who's in charge so let me ask you do you have somebody well let me ask you a question
okay goe if you're born into a dynasty let's say a banking Dynasty and you're born a billionaire and you have
everything you've ever wanted ever and money has absolutely no value at all and a brand new Ferrari doesn't mean a thing
you could buy one every 10 minutes for the rest of your life and money doesn't make you happy what's the one thing
that's going to make you happy controlling others controlling others power yeah ego so then you sit there and
start looking at things because games become real absolutely so now you're like okay well money doesn't satisfy me
what makes me feel important especially if you're going to add in let's add in another angle to it let's imagine you
falsely believe because it is falsely that you're somehow genetically better than others you're from this lineage
you're better than the other people and the other people the Surfs and peasants are struggling for money and you have unlimited money because you're so smart
and your family's always been so smart you'll have hotty eyes yeah so then you're going to sit there and go well
why did they make people put on a mask when they walked in the restaurant and take the mask off to eat and then put it
on to go to the toilet and then take it off to eat and then put it back on because I I have I have I'll tell you
why because it's funny you think it's just because it's funny because it's an ego because it's ego I thought it was a
test to see how far they could push some compliance tests which is the same thing so when you really understand that
people who are in charge of the world are completely like you said broken they are broken people money can't satisfy
them people said uh I keep referencing Co and I do that because it was something tangible that everybody lived through that is a very easy one to
reference it's this is actually it's a bad thing that could work in your favor because now they could relate to you
yeah did you guys know we do live shows well technically we've only had one real life show and it went
amazing thank you thank you thank you thank you and next year we're going to be doing so many more if you want me to
come to your city text me here this number so I can know where to go I'll see I'll be like oh look Chicago or oh New York or oh
Minneapolis okay okay enjoy the show enjoy the show there's a they went through that so it's hard to explain to
a a broke kid what a rich kid goes through or what a rich kid what a broke person goes through so this is actually
a huge blessing do you think that covid and people's frustration and what happened to them link them to understand
your theories more oh absolutely a lot of when I was saying during Co about the Matrix everyone called me crazy and by
the end of Co a lot of people were like Andrew you nailed it day one CU I don't think many people understand cuz I
wasn't nearly as famous then but the videos exist on the internet me and my brother were the kings of Co everyone
else now understands it was garbage everyone else talks tough everyone else has their story about how they went out during but you're tough now on day one
of covid day one when they still had the people falling over in the street in China what was that that video yeah they
just running in the street dropping dead yep when the Italian hospital was overrun day one my brother and I sat
down and had a conversation in our war room our Cigar Lounge which look very similar to this and we sit down and said if this disease will kill people like
you and I military males then the world is over it's zombie apocalypse so what are we going to do and we sat there and
decided whether we should hide as long as possible or we just go out all guns blazing so we decided to go out all guns blazing like Heroes this is all
documented it's on video and day one of Co when everyone else was afraid we flew to Sweden because it was the only open
country and we spent the next four months ironic yeah cuz who lives in Sweden very strange we spent the last
next four months in Stockholm and six nights a week in nightclubs with Swedish chicks partying while the rest of the
world was locked in their house nobody talks about this nobody talks about the fact that Sweden was open no restrictions you could do whatever you
wanted nightclubs were open everyone was partying everyone else was locked up not allowed to go to funerals we were literally in parties all day every day I
didn't even get sick didn't even get a cold and it was cold outside didn't even get the sniffles so we we beat Co we won
Co early so even after this experience for the next two years of Co I'm trying to scream at people listen wake up and
like oh they wouldn't just put it on the news they wouldn't just lie to us and try and scare us all for no reason until
you understand the good and evil in the world and you understand that's how the devil actually operates but the point I was going to make earlier about talking
about how these people are broke in and money doesn't satisfy them people often say ah Co was just for money and I say
that's actually a very optimistic view of the world it wasn't just for money it was for something far worse they have
money they have they print money yeah they make money they are the money when when I found out about the I just
learned about how they print money I literally could not believe money real for 3 days I'm sitting around so I'm
like what the [ __ ] is this so they could just print this [ __ ] money is not real it's not real they just print it it's not real Fair please yeah so money is
are real and I say that to people it's not about money no it's not about money so what's about it's about power control because when you get to a certain level
of wealth and I'll talk from my own personal experience I want people to understand I come from the lowest possible socioeconomic background I come
from a single mother household my father and mother broke up when I was nine I lived in luten England which is the worst town in England I grew up and went
to a school with a 3% pass rate everyone around me was stabbing each other and selling drugs I thought you said your
father was one of the best fathers you've ever had he he was but my mother and father broke up and he stayed in America and I moved to England and he
wasn't financially successful but he taught me other lessons and I'm glad he didn't give me money because I think
that a harsh upbringing and a harsh life makes a man a man I don't think you learn a lesson in any other way but I
come from the absolute bottom and now I'm up at a position where we have a very large empire a lot
of it Shadow most people don't know what it is but even our overt things even our University and things that are online are turning over $520 million a week so
we're doing crazy sums of money so I've been from the absolute bottom to the absolute top I've seen it all and once
you get past a certain level of wealth once you get past a certain level of money yeah but then you re then you understand what money is right so we say
about money not being real money is not real from a governmental perspective because they just print it it's nothing but money is truthfully the stored time
and energy of other people if you have money you have stored time and energy of other humans because hourly rates that's
right because I can take that money and make someone else use their time and energy for X thing got it so it's a
different version of slavery absolutely because if if I'm going to come along and say you're no longer my slave as my
slave you had to work for for a house and a car you're no longer my slave in slavery let's look let's actually look
at slavery slavery began that way yeah and slavery said you work on my Plantation I give you somewhere to eat or I'll give you my daughter yeah this
is how people would work and that's why they were like oh your Bible believes in slavery I'm like slavery was different it wasn't it wasn't like there was
bondages there was SL that's why the Egyptians that's a whole different type of slave but the origination of slave
was like a debt I'm paying you a debt yep yep completely so let's look at even American slavery the slavery that most
Americans understand you're going to work for me I'm going to give you a house and I'm going to give you food and you're going to stay here and you're going to work slavery is abolished so
now what do we do you're going to work for me I'm going to give you that I'm going to give you some money and that money is enough to only buy you a house
and some food we've just put money in the middle now if I can make you do whatever I want for money and I can
print as as much money as I want you're my slave because I can print it from the sky and you need it to live so you are
my slave money is not real so I have all of this money I have the stored time and energy of other humans and once you get
past a certain level of wealth you understand which ties back to co that you're not interested in money what you're interested in is people it's
always been about having good people around you you want a beautiful doting loving woman who's obsessed with you you
want good brothers who will stand by you and make you motivated you want bodyguards who are going to protect you you want you want people
and then you want to look at it further down the rabbit hole you want to get more Sinister if you've been born into a lineage or a dnasty or the people who
control the world you want people you want robot people you don't want to be spoken to disrespectfully in your Empire
in your podcast Empire right you now have a podcast would you allow a member of staff to come along and say this is
[ __ ] I don't like how you do this this is [ __ ] I you're [ __ ] would you fire him I don't know if I would fire them I would first try to teach them how
to behave and if they didn't listen they're out absolutely so let's imagine you r a country
okay all right you let's imagine you ran the world and then then let's imagine there's this guy called top G who sits
down there and because because the most Googled man in the world for telling the world that make that CO's a lie and you're making everybody run around and
do everything you say you're going to allow that person to get away with it and now you start to understand Ah that's how the Matrix operates so the
people who are broken raised on money are so obsessed with power and control which is which explains a lot of the
society we're in because they don't look up to God these people think they are God that's that's the biggest fault and
and they're trying to make robots of us all they're trying to enslave us I I I you know it bothers me more than
anything is when I walk into an establishment and the person who's working is like go to there and they point at a machine what breaks my heart
is that machine is going to replace you yep and you have no idea so you've
gotten in a place where the person above you is encouraging you to be rep that's
like hey see yourself out legitimately y see yourself out but people don't think they don't and they lack absolutely lack
perspicacity and then you go further down the rabbit hole because like I said there's layers to the rabbit hole how I don't how Alex Jones you want me to go
but he's right about a he's right about a lot of things so you're an Alex Jones fan I I like a lot of the things he says
and I'm not saying I agree with everything he says but a lot of the things he says have been proven to be absolutely true you know you say
conspiracy theorist nowadays that just means you're ahead of the curve unfortunately and Alex was talking about
and a lot of other people talking about and there's a lot of text which talks about the fact that the people who are in charge of the
world they believe that as AI improves a huge percentage of the planet are going
to become useless ears they don't need you anymore I'll give that actually
scares me the guy who created it even is scared of it well that's the thing so let's let's give a thought experiment as
it stands right now most people are so uninteresting and so unremarkable that you could replace them online with a
chat GPT ball and you wouldn't really know this genuinely that's how boring most humans are if you're special and
remarkable and unique and you're famous or you do whatever that's different but most people you could replace with chat GPT by text you wouldn't even notice and
that is a free application which is brand new imagine we're going to be in 20 years from now so we start talking about useless eaters this has been
discussed by very important very powerful people at length the same people who are trying to give you the vaccine are talking about the fact that
the population of the earth needs to decline why do they why do we need they say it Bill Gates says it why do we need
to get rid of people well machines will do it so why do we need people sitting around who have hopes dreams aspirations
they want Health Care they want safety security children all of this garbage we just need somebody to do X job and a
machine can do X job so what do we need these people for so then you start looking I find it weird that Hollywood was the first one to strike about it but
it was about actors well yeah because have you ever asked chat GPT to write a movie like that bro it's better than
anything you've seen in Hollywood in a long time there's no woke [ __ ] there's no trans lesbian black double
[ __ ] [ __ ] hero so it's you know what's so funny is that like
this episode is definitely going to like [ __ ] my account up but I'm in for it I I like i' rather be like real and like if
I got God forbid if I passed away I just want to make sure that I was authentic absolutely and so I'm really I'm really
enjoying this conversation absolutely um so they're going to wipe people out with robots how do you get in the way of that
so you want to be the Superman of this generation it's not about me it's not it's not about me trying to be the Superman because I'm not that arrogant I
it's just about me understanding what I know is going to happen and feeling like if God has given me a platform which
people listen to me I should at least tell the truth of what's going to happen when I'm sitting there and saying to men look Life as a man is [ __ ] it's always
been [ __ ] it's never been good when men wake up and say I'm depressed and life is hard and I'm sad and I'm struggling
right now I say okay throughout history men have always struggled happiness is
for children and women name a time in history it was better to be a man was it better to be a man in World War II was
it better to be man on the Titanic was it better to be a man in the Napoleonic Wars was it better to be a man when you were sitting in Vienna and the Mongol
horde arrived ready to decapitate any male and enslave all the females when's
it ever been good to be a man building the pyramids was that fun it's always sucked the only time being a man ever is
good is if you become an exceptional man which is even something feminists admit because feminists sit and complain about
men and say well men have this men have that but they're talking about 2% of men fascinating they don't talk about all
men they say men have the best jobs 2% of men have the best jobs most men carry trash so you're talking crap so everyone
accepts that the best possible Human Experience that exists is the top 2% of men anything below that sucks as a man
you're better off being a chick so what I say to men is look life's hard it's always going to be hard it's always going to suck it always has the only way
to get out is to become excellent and perform at a level where your Echelon is so high that you get to live this brand
new experience you need to become strong and smart and interesting and charismatic you need to become rich powerful well-known connected you need
to do it but could all men do that no so okay but I have to tell them the truth
when people come along to me and say my life's [ __ ] and I look at them and go yes do you feel like you can change do
you think you could change all of that just from a perspective I'll give you one um I am happy all the time now I was
in a bad place because I realized I was just focusing on bad things and I was being a [ __ ] and not fixing what I
needed to fix once I fix what I I needed to fix I started focusing on the good things in life like today I'm sitting
with Reed we're having breakfast and I looked down and we had a buffet and I had a crazy amount of plate like just a crazy plate I took a video of it and I
looked at him and I go do you realize even the greatest men a thousand years ago wouldn't be
able to have all of this decorated on the plate and we throw this out y so it's perspective agre so do you think
that you need to make more rich men or more rich in the heart men that's a very good question and when I say rich I
teach financials because I think financials are important it's a tool it's a tool and you have a responsibility to take care of your
family so I I think that as a man your happiness comes from feeling respected
over feeling loved and the reason perhaps you're happy now is because you have more respect for yourself because
of the decisions you're making and you have self resect and I think that a lot of men even if they have self-respect if
nobody else respects them they're struggling I think male depression can be be fixed with respect I want to tap
Andrew Doesn't Believe Depression Is A Disease
into depression what's your thoughts on that I I think that it's massively overdiagnosed I say depression isn't
real because I speaking absolutes I think the idea of feeling depressed is real I don't feel the I don't feel like
it's a clinical disease that you catch from the sky and it can't be fixed I feel like depression is feedback pain is
feedback and your mind and body is telling you something must change and if you make those changes you will feel
happier I don't buy into the idea that it is a disease I think it's situational and you must change your situation and
your actions and your decisions to feel better and that's why I say it's not real it's not a disease I I have a point
of view on it I wanted to share mine and see if it kind of matches yours and if you have a a viewpoint on it sure um
when I grew up I was I I like to describe myself and now a lot of people get annoyed about that and they're like why do you talk about your cuz who the
[ __ ] am I going to talk about do you know what I mean like I hate that like I'm not going to sit there and talk about Joe I don't know who the [ __ ] Joe is I'm going talk about George George
was raised if I came home I had a really tough childhood that's documented I have
childhood when it came to making friends I wasn't educated they didn't know I was dyslexic I had a lot of problems when I
came home if I ever looked at my mom like I'm depressed she goes no you're not and she nipped it right there stop
saying that and then I grew up and I'm reflecting I'm going to bring it back to
the Bible yeah in the beginning was the what in the beginning was light wasn't
it in the beginning was the stars and uh I should know this in the beginning was the word the word word you're right and
he created everything with what his mouth Y and everything's vibration yep people that don't even believe in God
believe in energy yes okay I think that we got to a place where if I looked at you every single
day and I was somebody you cared about and was like you're depressed bro you have an you're anxiety you have anxiety
I have anxiety so if I'm telling myself this every single time I have a problem I'm feeding myself this Bruce Lee had a
thing saying don't joke about yourself cuz your body doesn't even know what's a joke J or not right so the philosophy
that I'm going about is are you talking it into existence are you uh what's the word um manifesting it of course you are
so I don't understand why people they go to a therapist or they go to medication
but they won't fix their [ __ ] mouth first it's so interesting you say this because when I say depression isn't real and it's situational and you have to
change your situation to feel better people often come back to me and say well what about celebrities because celebrities live perfect lives and they
kill themselves and I I argue that with the exact point you made because a celebrity sits there Robin Williams I'm
depressed and instead of people sitting down with him and saying Robin listen shut the [ __ ] up shut the [ __ ] up you you you're you're as famous as you can
get you live the most privileged life you can live you can have a 19-year-old girlfriend tomorrow let's find out
what's making you sad let's go on Safari let's see some tigers or get rid of the [ __ ] that's making you depressed completely there's no attack towards
making progress there's just trying to take the easy way out one labeling myself sorry guys I can't do it today I
have anxiety or I have depression now you there might be some people out there that actually wake up and they have a
lot of things on them I think you need to find God oh absolutely that's it because if you had a God you would know
that you could cast your anxieties and depress on him now having faith is a big
thing for me Big Thing If I Didn't Have Faith all the obstacles I would look at let me give you an example when I first
started the show I was like I don't know how but I'm going to have this conversation with you now [ __ ] crazy
I came off of impulsive some people might not even want to do anything with me cuz I was laugh that kid but I
manifested and I pushed and I encouraged myself I could have sat around like a [ __ ] and be like oh no one's going to
give a [ __ ] about me no one's going to do this no one's going to do that but if I can't care about myself if I can't push myself and if I can't encourage
myself who the [ __ ] going to come around and do that for me nobody's going to care about you more than you nobody's nobody's going to wake up each morning
and go you know what Andrew Tate only has 53 cars he needs a 54th car I'm G to get up and I'm going to work car and buy him a car no no that's my job it did
your money make you happier or did it cause you more more anxiety okay that's a really interesting question which
we'll talk about actually but everything you said about depression is super true and and Robin Williams his mistake is
that he went to a therapist who confirmed his bias confirmed he's depressed they then sat there and talked
about being depressed three times a week for two hours a day then they put him on mind altering drugs to make him feel better and after nine years of therapy
he jumped off the building if I were to take mind altering drugs and talk about being sad all day every day I'd probably jump off a building too so it's
absolutely the wrong thing you can do and I want to make a point here because when I talk about depression people always defend it I said this I was
having a conversation with somebody by the way hold on hold on defending what you have depression I have depression but we don't sit around [ __ ] moping
about it but the depressed people do this is the interesting you can't get mad at us for not going in the motion that you want to go about you're trying
to say that you're getting mad at me for saying that I don't sit in my depression yeah I'm not saying that depression doesn't exist I'm saying that I'm not
giving it flowers everything is a mustard seed if you water that [ __ ] it's going to [ __ ] grow what I don't
understand is that the reap and sew is everything that anyone does but people will reap one thing and then when
they're sewing this [ __ ] they'll be like wait why did I get this why did I get this yeah I'm like cuz you were [ __ ] yeah you planted this crop but
every single day you were talking about that crop y absolutely completely true and I said this to I said this many
times before I don't believe in things that take away power from me I don't care if depression is real I don't care
if I'm wrong I don't believe in something that takes away power from me because I can't become depressed if I don't believe in depression and that
allows me to Shield my my mind from the idea of being a depressed person I can feel depressed temporarily but I can
never become a depressed person because it doesn't exist you can lock me in a Romanian jail cell for 93 days with cockroaches I will not be depressed I
will feel a little bit sad of course but I will never become a depressed person because I don't believe in it and when I
say this depressed people like no depression's real it's real in my life it's taken everything from me depression is real depression is real I said you
sound like it's promotional team you sound their it's their God they're worshiping it you're worshiping it
because it gives you a cure all EXC excuse for your Monumental failures as opposed to waking up and going you know
what maybe I'm a [ __ ] up nothing to do with depression maybe I just been [ __ ] up maybe depression isn't real and I've just been [ __ ] up and I
should fix a few of these things what have I been reaping ex absolutely and you'd be amazed how depression will lose
power over your life and lose its ability to destroy your life if you stop giving it so much respect and just wake
up and say let me fix x y and Zed what can I control Let Me Clear just in case there's some people that might not catch
up to our speed I do not believe that some people sorry let me rephrase this I
believe that some people are depressed every single day but I believe that their steps into fixing that is one
first and foremost find God immediately two instead of running to somebody and
expressing your problems every single day just sitting there just telling somebody your problems every single day
find some friends go to the gym instead of talking about your problems talk about your goals talk about your dreams
focus on something that is not negative if there's two wolves and I'll say this every time I've said this a few times
there's two wolves Andrew one's chained up in the dark one's chained up in the light which one lives yeah absolutely
the one in the light the one you feed interesting so I could feed the one
in the dark all day and it's going to live and the one in the light's going to die correct what are you focusing on correct so I'm not saying that if you're
depressed that it's in your head I believe that you're putting it in your head and I believe that you could fix
this by your mouth start by taking actions and taking accountability for
what you are saying the people are jacked go in the mirror it sounds stupid but it's true bro look how [ __ ]
jacked I'm getting look how jacked I'm getting and guess what they start getting jacked why cuz they're motivating themselves to get in the gym
eat healthier they consistently talk about their body so when bad food gets put on their table they're like nah I
don't want this right now y it's all about your mouth your tongue is the sharpest thing in the world and then then we use that in the adverse right
you can use that the other way around this is why I answered the light wolf because I believe that your mind was
focused on it absolutely but let's use it the other way around so you can speak yourself also positive which we know but
George Debates Andrew On Using Pride As Your Main Motivator
I think there's a mistake that a lot of people make with that a lot of people are obsessed with the idea of happiness
and especially as a man I think that happiness can actually be a very destructive motivator and when men sit
and say I want to be happy I want to feel happy to feel happy a lot of the time you're looking for temporary headism to be happy you want to get
drunk or take drugs or do something stupid temporarily and it's very short-lived I think you should instead
be looking as a man to say I want to feel proud if you choose Pride over happiness you're going to make decisions
that you're proud of and that people around you are proud of and it's going to be better better for yourself and better for society and better for
everyone who loves you everyone you care about I think that's the first thing you said that I disagree with you disagree I
think the best thing a man can do is wake up and say what can I do that's going to make me proud of myself and other people are proud of me let's get
into our debate let's do it okay I believe that Pride it always be the downfall of you in fact God calls it an
Abomination if you stand before God and you search for anything in your heart and you take pride in it you're saying that you did it not God that is my
argument against that one two happiness could be today it's all perspective if you look at a tree you could look at it
be like oh me and my dad used to pick apples from that tree or his father hung himself in that tree it's the perspective so anything could be changed
in a perspective so if you ask from God's perspective and you God used to walk into the room and say shalom peace
be upon you so I believe you could enter peace I believe that you could only find peace when you welcome God into your
life now sound like a crazy nutcase that's a religious man but I truly believe in all of my heart that money
will never give you peace yep I believe love will give you peace love comes from God and the people that are around you
your mother gives you peace your father gives you peace you can't buy that and if you ask God for five things only five
things Andrew your Bugatti wouldn't be there absolutely but your brother would of course so you come into the world with peace yeah and love so that's you
don't think pride is one of the biggest motivators of masculine Excellence you don't think no because once you achieve it you want more and that's where not
think Mayweather decided he wanted to be proud of himself by beating everyone and just pick on YouTubers and
box them of course Michael I'm not I'm not insulting Mayweather good or bad but
actually I might cut that because it might jump me so Michelangelo okay he cut his ear off okay artists Da Vinci
what I'm saying is some of the most beautiful works of art some of the most gorgeous Cathedrals some of the most beautiful churches you'll ever Lay Your
Eyes on were done because a man felt proud of his work feeling pride pride in yourself that being PR of course but
being pride pride so you're looking at the art and you're try that's Pride you want everybody to take pride into you but guess what Andrew right now if you
died regardless of all the work you've done regardless of all of everything that youve put in I'm a better man
Reed's a better man divid is a better man I forgot your name I'm so sorry Bailey Bailey's a better man all these
guys are a better man for two three generations but when you die you have the same grave of a man that you hate
because time moves on of course everything collects moth and rust so what's the point you don't think God can
give you pride in yourself for doing the right things I think that you could find joy in it but again everything has its
time so you take pride in your art but at one point all those artists became crazy bro so what's the [ __ ] worth of
it okay I understand that so we can look at a bunch of different ways but you just talked about a man looking in the mirror and being proud of his body to
motivate himself that's Pride absolutely Pride to an extent right Pride to an extent but if it's your motivator that's
the problem everybody needs a certain type of emotion you need fear but you're not going to live fear through we have our
default emotions that we seek and this is the point I'm making because when I talk to people I think we all have our default emotions we seek and depressed
people their default emotion that they're looking for is sympathy they want sympathy either from themselves or
from somebody else and they always have a sub story it's always about how hard their life was and they did drugs and blah blah blah and they want everyone to
feel sorry for them they're searching for sympathy if you're the kind of person who searches for happiness whether male or female in my experience
people who search for happiness end up doing head istic temporary stupid things when I find men who search to feel proud
of themselves I want people to be proud of me and I want to be proud of myself and I want to be respected they often
delay happiness they often go through very difficult things and build things which are beautiful or build things
which are difficult to do they often go to the other side of fear to feel that Pride I did it I faced my fear I did it
so I think as a man searching for Pride or searching to feel proud is a pretty
positive mindset for m achievement I understand what you're saying from the biblical sense I actually understand what you're saying but I just say if you
were to take a man and say how would you make your parents your girlfriend and yourself proud of you I agree I just
don't want it to be the driving vehicle that's the only thing I care about I just don't want it to be the driving vehicle right and then I have to sit
here and analyze myself is pride the driving vehicle for me like why do I even why do I even do what I do like do
I feel proud of myself when I awaken people to how the Matrix works well yes
but is that is that because I believe I'm helping them or do I just feel happy in and of myself why do I own all the things I own why do I want all the
things I want and it's very interesting you asked the question earlier before we got down this point when you said has money made me happier or made me more
anxious and the answer to that is is both I think that you're certainly
anxious when you have an Empire because you're you understand how difficult it is to maintain especially in my position right I've been hit by decal and FBI and
all these huge federal agencies who trying to take everything I've ever worked for and from your loved ones from my loved ones all the money I've ever
made it's it's actually a very difficult precarious situation to be in and even if you ever get to the position where you pay yourself half a million dollars
every single morning you get concerned with am I still going to be allow am I still going to be able to do this then
the money ain't making you happy you're working so hard to make sure you'll always be able to pay yourself that money that you don't even spend that you don't even need that's the pride thing I
was trying to tell you of course of course this is how you hold on and it's a stomach that keeps kneading it does
keep kneading you're completely right but that's also how there's no light without dark the stomach keeps kneading
completely agree with you but that's also how I managed to propel myself from here to here here and I'm going to go
want to beat this garbage even high so I agree with you there's no it's my gas my
gas is and then so there's anxiety did that change when you got a daughter I think in some ways it got
How Andrew Actually Benefits From His Money
worse cuz there's anxiety attached to my money but the true happiness that I get from my money is the fact that I can
give people I care about anything I want you could set them free I can set them free yeah so I said this even to a girl
I was dating I said you're happy all the time and I love this that cuz I'm
stressed and I'm not complaining about being stressed I think the masculine role is to wake up I wake up stressed I
wake up and I've got a bunch to do a bunch of people to talk to a bunch of money to make Etc I'm stressed I'm not
miserable but I'm certainly concerned all of the time I'm focused all of the time I'm always busy I have a lot going
on I'm never relaxed I'm never at peace that's not who I am as a person do you think people confuse stress with
depression I think so and I think that you're supposed to be stressed saying so maybe they feel what you're feeling but
you've you've said that it's stress which is good you need stress you need to have your back up against the wall or
you going to be a lazy [ __ ] or you won't do anything yes absolutely but people might think that emotion because they
feel that emotion that stress that's on them and then somebody comes out of the woodwork be like oh that's depression
yeah which is a coward's ways out but I actually love feeling stressed I do best when I'm stressed I've had 87
professional fights for about three of those fights for some reason I wasn't nervous and it really bothered me like
why am I not nervous I I like feeling nervous I like being stressed I I fight better I react quicker if you ever been
jump like you get scared if someone jumps out at you that's when you're the fastest you've ever been y so I think
stress is a fantastic motivator it's a it's a beautiful thing but I was saying to this girl I don't get any of the
happiness you get from life you wake up and you do your nails and you shop for Prada and you get to look gorgeous and you smile all day and you get to make a
cute cupcake and you bring me the cupcake and you laugh hahaa cupcake I'm concerned with real important things decot are trying to put me in jail
millions of dollars have gone missing like I'm dealing with real stuff you're dealing with cupcakes but I am happy
that I go through all of this so I can make you happy yeah so my money makes me happy yeah I'm a provider my money makes
me happy because every single person I love lives a fantastic life if I have to suffer if I have to suffer so 50 people
can live content I believe that a man should do that I think you have a m you
have a warrior mindset right um and you have people that you care for and you provide for you have your brother and you have your family um do you feel like
your stress comes from holding on to what you hold dear that Pride aspect of things like I got to be top G nobody's
top G I'm top G you know where I actually think it comes from I actually think it comes from because I know I've only reached 10% of
what I can actually do let's go bro and that bothers me and no matter how much money I'm making or how was Googled man
alive whatever whatever I can still identify the inefficiencies in my systems I can still identify where more
money could have been made and money isn't that important but like we said money is a very simple way to measure
success because it's numbers numbers are easy this number that number it's easy what does a company do when it wants to
measure the success of a company it looks at the numbers what does a YouTube channel do it looks at the numbers numbers are easy so if you're going to
say how do I be successful in life money is not everything but it's a nice easy way to measure because it's numbers and
then when you understand it's the time and energy of other people you sit and go okay well I have this large empire now and I have all these people who work
for me and all these people I love and all these people I care about and all these children and all this going on and the world is getting more and more messed up and everything's on a decline
and everything's being destroyed and certain number of people are going to become useless eaters are going to be eradicated and they're going to try and to lock us all in our 15minute cities
for the climate or some garbage that's coming in no time how do I combat and fight all of this and protect all the
people I care about well I need the time and energy of others I need an army so I need money so you start waking up saying
okay 1 billion is [ __ ] Tristan and he's like Andrew we're from a single mother
household and our company got valued at $1.2 billion and you Own 100% of it no
we need at least 10 and then you start get then I get mad and my stress comes from the fact that I don't have enough
but is it for me or is it for just being able to care about all the people I care about well from how you described it it
seems like you're just gearing up for war and a man who knows his next move knows his next problems y so I think
you're four steps ahead and you're looking at eight problems somebody said it do you want more coffee or I'd love more coffee could you get two more from
him I someone said it and I can't remember who said it but it said that that Finance are the uh I think it was
I'm so sorry could you I know you have headphones on yeah sorry Finance are the senu I can't remember the exact saying but he said it perfectly he basically
said that money is if you're going to go to war get your money right yeah of course absolutely what are we sending to Ukraine right now billions of dollars
The Government Is STILL Holding All Of Andrew's Assets & How He's Surviving
money what are we send to Israel money money money money right so if I feel like I'm going to go to war I need money
and even in this war I've been in even when I went to jail right not a lot of people understand how the legal system
works but the process itself is a punishment the day I was arrested all of my bank accounts were Frozen all of my
cars were seized that's scary dude yeah all of my cars were seized all of my diamond watches were taken $900,000 in
cash was taken gold bars was taken all of my value was taken right so since January technically I haven't had access
to a dollar it's now been a year and I don't have a penny according to decal
and the Romanian legal system luckily I have some good friends who look after me but let's say he winked at me like I had that
fun I don't taken everything officially so you still don't have your stuff back no no of course not so this is my point
why are you still here well I can't leave but okay are you going to leave once you can because I feel like they
just prove that you can't speak here either well that's the thing that's scary if you can't speak here which is
the most Christian country on Earth you know Romania outside of Vatican City is the most Christian country on the planet 99 like 98% and then the other two are
like like a different denomination that's right most Christian country on the planet and all I'm talking about is
traditional masculinity and do you are you upset with them for what they did or do you feel like they had valid reasons to do what they did as a man you have to
take self-accountability for absolutely everything I'm still upset with what they've done however there are equal
opposing forces inside of Romania one trying to lock me up and one that keeps setting me free and that's going to be
everywhere yeah so I have people in this country on my team the whole country is not against me or I never would have got
out so do you feel like they're more moving towards your direction this this will be dropped I'm not going to be
found guilty cuz I done anything wrong but um and if you don't mind me asking what did they try to pin you for they accused me of human trafficking they
accused me of using the lover boy method which is convincing Girls by being nice to do a job to take the money from the
girls because I told two of my friends who are girls how to get big on Tik Tok that's why all of this happened to
you yeah um so did somebody else plant this on you oh yeah the make got you got too big your ability to speak which
that's a side point let me just finish here about what I was talking about money and gearing up for war since January I haven't had access to a single
dollar now I'm me right so perhaps I have very rich friends perhaps I was paranoid and prepared perhaps I have
multiple identities who knows how I pulled it off to have all new cars again right but most humans could not survive
getting grabbed from their house in January all of their bank accounts Frozen every app on their phone taken
away from them their passport seized thrown in a cell and then taken out of that sell locked in their house for 5
months and then even when they're allowed out the house they still don't have a dollar how do you pay the rent how do you pay the bills how do you feed
people and this is was actually interesting because when I was in jail my number one concerns were not for me my biggest concerns when I was in jail
was for everyone I care about I'd get my phone time and I'd be on the phone like okay and they're like how what's what's going on what's going on I'm like listen
we only have five minutes let me make sure you get paid is this paid are you okay do you need this do you need that I
just spent all my time trying to look after other people from a prison cell with seized bank accounts did you think going to come out
no I thought I was there for a very long time I thought I was stuck I thought it was over I was I was sitting there talking to people who were there then
been there for four years without trial my friend everyone around me had been there for years without trial when you were put on house arrest yeah was there
any moment that you cried from like happiness it's like I'm out I can't believe I'm out I never cried from
happiness and I never cried from sadness because I think crying is an act in and
of itself to cry is to sit and cry I didn't do that I did have tears run down
my face hey man that's crying no it's not because I was busy having tears run
down my face as I'm doing push-ups or tears run down my face as I'm organizing the school for my child and my voice
isn't breaking is different than sitting and crying I didn't sit and dedicate myself to crying I didn't sit and do the
act of crying my eyes leaked as I achieved that's what happened to me when I was inside of jail what made your eyes
leak the most what was the most concern that was on your heart my concern was for everybody else the number one though
who's the person that you were like I need to make sure that I look good in their eyes and I need to make sure that they're good of course I can answer that
my children but my children are actually quite young so they they weren't overly concerned because at their age you know
Dad's way whatever um I'm not entirely sure I think it was just an overarching
view of everything and I I felt a frustration because I had built this Monumental Empire and it got seized from
me which is a whole another conversation we can go down when you talk about ownership and property and how the Matrix works you don't own anything well
well you never do I mean you owned all this but then they're like that's right so what do you own you own the body
you're in perhaps but then they force you to get a vaccine so maybe you don't own that anymore you own your soul you can own your thoughts but then that
belongs to God so then what do you even own now on this planet because I have people say to me all the time oh I'd love to buy a house and I own my house
you don't own that house you have to pay property taxes every month and if you don't pay them they'll take it off you you're renting it from the government
piss the government off and you'll see how long you own your house cuz I tell you what's going to happen they're going to turn up with a piece of paper and say it's ours done happened to me so you
never even own anything on this Earth no matter how much money you have right which also puts money in perspective all
it is is the time and energy of other people it's all it's good for you can buy a Bugatti but you don't own that Bugatti you can drive it a bit if they
let you and piss The Matrix off enough they'll take that off you too so the whole world if you actually start analyzing how it all works it's
interesting but yeah my concerns in jail Warfare absolutely everybody else and that's perhaps why I'm gearing up for
war so heavily because I believe that this war can't be avoided and a lot of people ask me why with my money do I not
do one of two things which is one vanish cuz I could just delete everything and shut up right I could just go away but that's not you that's not me and and I
think that God would be disappointed in me so I think God's given me this platform to tell the truth so I'm going to do it or the second thing is I could
sell out to the system I could cut also not you it's not me I could sell to the system say what they want me to say
promote the things they want me to promote sell [ __ ] to kids be a piece of [ __ ] and then they'll let me live but
then you just remove the only thing that you do own and it's your soul absolutely and you don't want them to take that
away no no exactly I need to keep something so it ain't worth giving that up for a bit more money because I have
unlimited money anyway yeah but plus every time you swipe that card when you're gone you're like [ __ ] my life dog this is any oh completely what do you
have if you don't if you don't look in the mirror and be like yeah I did the right thing then what do you even have oh boom not Pride but Integrity okay
well we could link the two could you look in the mirror and be proud of yourself but it's it's interesting no but it's interesting the points you've made it's giving me something to think
The Matrix War Is Coming For Everyone & Everyone Will Pick A Side
about it's certainly true but that's why I'm gearing up for war so heavily because this war when people ask me why
I don't try and avoid it in the two ways we just described I don't think most people understand that this war is coming for everyone it can't be avoided
you're either going to become someone like me who's fighting against it the counterculture or you're going to buy
into it and be a victim of it I don't think any man who wakes up and accepts the garbage that the Matrix tells them
that yeah it's okay to be depressed like we just talked about yeah you should be running around doing perkys and Aderall
and consuming porn and sleeping with a bunch of hoes and yeah go to school and get education and get in debt and then
go get a mortgage and get in debt and then 9 to5 and just slave away and you'll be retired when you're 74 it's
going to be fine all the things they push all the standardized mechanisms that a man supposed to live his life by
I believe lead to crippling depression and sadness anyway I don't think that makes anyone happy so this war is
twofold you can either fight against the system and be its enemy like I am or you
can accept the system and then you're be fighting against yourself in your head because now you're your own enemy
because you've listened to the system and you hate yourself and you hate your life so what do you want to do if you can't avoid fighting do you want to turn
on yourself or do you want to turn on your enemy every single part of me is on my team my mind my hands my feet
everything my teeth you name it if it goes to war I've got every single weapon at my disposal so when people say to me
why am I fighting this War I say you're in the war too you're just going to be a casualty of it you're going to be a forgotten name not even a name you're
going to be a number in Wars It's it's interesting in Wars you look at any War they'll talk about 12,000 people died
here and one of them was this guy there's names and there's numbers so if
you're going to go to war you can decide you want to be a name or a number because people are going to die people are going to die regardless and this is
why I teach the things I teach I say to men listen you need to become as strong as possible you need to make a bunch of money you need to prepare you need to
have seven passports in seven different countries and you just start sitting there getting paranoid and panicking and getting things done this is why I push
mascul in excellence cuz when they come for you when they come for us all if you have no weapons to defend yourself you're going to be one of the 12,000 in
the ditch at least when at least when they kill me they know who they killed at least they say they killed 12,000 men
and Andrew Tate yeah at least I get that you have to aim for something but this
war can't be avoided and everyone at home doesn't seem to realize that here's the thing that like I'm going to put you a little bit at ease and scare you at
the same time I'm ready they killed Jesus dude you know what I mean like if you think about it they killed God yeah
yeah obviously he wanted it to happen thank God he did but here's the craziest part hey man this is the way of life oh
oh absolutely this is the way of life and I don't I don't sit around anymore and and I don't fear it um and when you
talk about uh pride and you talk about all the stuff we were talking about I found this new confidence uh where I
walk in a room and I just own it immediately um and it's a new way of thinking my confidence comes with the
Lord every room I walk into this meeting I said God you go before me y
you take my tongue you take my mind you take my body when you walk into a room and you have this type of Faith
hypothetically say I'm an idiot say I am completely a nutcase I guarantee you I I
outworked the old George that didn't have that Faith oh absolutely and you can also play the same to fighting like
if you look at the Islamic Fighters they say all glory to God God's already decided I'm just going to go in there they they're they're so calm that's and
by the way that's scary dud super scary yo if you walk into a dude and he's just super calm that's doesn't care [ __ ] all
that I don't even want to be here anymore absolutely yeah like if if I were to agree and if I were to do a fight now I know that's in God's hands
so I I I'd be as calm I'd be nervous of course and I'd want to be nervous but I'd know like look this is in God's
hands God's already decided he all is the best of planners he will decide if I need to win and Destroy This Man or if I need to lose and learn a lesson then
it's up to God that's working off of fear not faith faith is Faith is so beautiful and you could use it and fear
is such a poison bro and I don't know if you've really hung out with people that have fear it's a it's um it's an
addictive person oh it's sticky it's very sticky very stick have you ever watched something on Tik Tok or
Instagram and then all day you're just thinking about it and you're like this [ __ ] can't leave my brain dude I I am now limiting myself on what I'm
absorbing bro I don't talk I want to make this very clear I've one of the
best things about money is I've managed to create my reality absolutely I don't talk to anyone I don't want to talk to
if you come to me and say we can make a $100 million but I don't like your shirt then you can get [ __ ] that's that's my
life now cuz I don't need money and I don't like you so that's who I am right so I've created my reality absolutely
and the number one thing I will not do is talk to negative people I don't want to hear I don't care what your story is I don't care what happened if all you do
is complain you are not around me cuz it is sticky it's sticky to you it's sticking to the universe it leaves a residue I don't want to hear it everyone
around me is happy and not only happy we're the kind of people if we're in a trench and we're getting shelled we're
laughing yep like missed woohoo that's who we are bro they just hit me with the
largest Matrix attack on the planet I should be destitute and disappeared here I am on your podcast I just pulled up at
a brand new sports car I'm like a cockroach and you drop the nuke to kill everyone the Cockroach crawls out with
top G on the back it's all a big it's all hilarious bro it's a joke human trafficking for Tik Tok the whole
thing's a joke but here I survive so you have to be that person and even my brother and I in jail sometimes we just
look at each other we'd be sitting there in jail and sometimes we' look at each other just burst out laughing like this it's so ridiculous but I don't have time
for negative people and and especially when negative people come out with their sub stories I guess I'm kind of fortunate that God has put me through so
many difficult things when people tell me their sub stories I'm sitting there going is that it you you're a [ __ ] up
because of that you should have seen what I had to do like so I don't even want to hear it I'm an interested in it and you're right you have to be careful
who you're around because you are the Su of The Five People You spend the most time with yeah you are who you hang out with dude there's a reason why God says
sheep y we're sheep yep we're all sheep bro I don't need to bring up my past but
my behaviors were untolerable because of the people around me oh absolutely you are who you hang out with my father
would tell me that all the time like hey cut it out bro you need to stop hanging out with these people that are bringing you down um you know what's interesting
about that point before we move on it's really interesting that people understand I've never met somebody who disagrees with the point you are the
person who you spend you you are the sum of the people you spend the most time with everyone agrees with that but then they hang around with [ __ ] well you
know why why where's the disconnect between those two points because people like for other people to feel bad for
them they hang on to that that's their identity sympathy yeah it's their identity what's their favorite emotion
sympathy like we said earlier their favorite emotion is sympathy they're looking for sympathy that's what they want that's what makes them feel good that's their favorite food you have to
choose what your favorite food is my favorite food I'll be honest with you and I I actually respect and you give me
a lot to think about and without being arrogant at my Echelon is not often I sit down with somebody and they say
something that makes me think but you've given me something to think about and I genuinely I'm GNA think about it but my
favorite food is pride I do and I and I don't know that's a bad thing but I love when my woman comes to me and goes you
know what you just fix everything they they had you in jail Andrew you you were
you were supposed to be done they're lying about you all over the MSM they're sing you're human trafficker they stole all your money they froze all your Banks
why am I on a jet with roses like cuz I'm the top G that's why cuz I I'm that
guy she's like you've just never failed I've never seen you fail it correct I do not fail I have something to tell you
the Power Of The Bible & God's Always Teaching Us Lessons
and just randomly I just learned about this and it fits you so well sure um I read again in the Bible there's going to
be so many people that like ah but I don't give sh but that's what the knowledge is my grandma is from Alabama and she's a strict Christian and she's
from Alabama like down the sticks the middle of dirt mud Alabama and she uh
one of my aunts is a lawyer and I remember my aunt sorry to interrupt you my aunt my aunt had a big court case
coming up and she'd spend half her time studying the case and half her time studying the Bible and I remember being
in her house I must have been about 7 or8 years old and my mother asked her her name is Liz Liz why are you reading
the Bible so often and she said because that's where all the answers are amen yeah so it's you keep referencing it I
reference it because if I if I reference myself I'm just leading you down a [ __ ] path yeah and and a lot of people get so
annoyed like you think you're so holier than th you think you're perfect then you're not listening to me I'm a filthy
dummy and I'm trying to get myself out of it yeah yeah yeah yeah Matthew asks Jesus I don't get it man why are you
talking to them in parables and Jesus says because you were given access to understand so check this out you just
said now I'm thinking about the pride thing I think that you weren't supposed to think about the pride thing I think God needed you to think this way but I
think now you're moving on to a different season absolutely so I think you might need to re-evaluate your tactic and we change every day yeah and
and that's the whole point of trials and tribulations and conversations and that's the whole point of perspicacity in the first place a lot of people lack
it feedback is such an important thing and feedback comes from life and from all areas and we actually talked about this I talked about this inside of my
War Room I've got the private organization the war room where people can join and it's a a masculine Network it's kind of like a boy club kind like
guys and we talk about making money and and fitness and all these other things but we were speaking and a couple of the highle War Room guys said Andrew I want
to learn to speak like you do the way you talk on podcasts is why they're so monumentally successful I want to speak
like you do how do you practice how often do you practice and I tried to explain to him I said brother you're 42
years old I'm 36 years old you've been speaking longer than me so it's it's not about practice the difference between
you and I is I pay attention and I make sure that I get feedback so if I do a
podcast I will watch it back and write down every time I made a mistake or every time I could have used a different word I will sit there and actually
analyze my work to get better you reflect I reflect if you don't reflect and you just speak you stay [ __ ] Reed
told me he goes I've never met a man and by the way I didn't even notice about this like have you ever like something you do all the time and you don't even
notice it and then somebody tells you and it [ __ ] you up you're like oh damn dude I I do do I over reflect a lot but here's the
thing dude I realized this as soon as he mentioned this to me I realized how other [ __ ] do not reflect at
all they'd rather watch other people than watch their [ __ ] mouth bro that
video where Jack dorsy had a security guard and everybody was so mad at my opinion on it here's the thing dude bad
things happen if you get punched in the face because of a security guard yeah he's wrong for that but why the [ __ ] are
you talking up to a dude eight times your size when he's angry do you have no common sense have you never been punched
in the face before you didn't try to deescalate it you were talking and getting mouthy right some people need to
get hit in the face for them to understand abrasive yeah it's true some
people only learn the hard way especially men God gives us God's actually very nice because I believe God
gives us a whole bunch of chances to learn a lesson the easy way it's called life of course he'll give you think of
think of the think of the harshest lesson you didn't even have to say what it is but think of the harshest lesson you've had in the last few years and think of how many times you had the easy
way to learn that lesson you could have just stopped being a [ __ ] before it got bad think how many times you could have just woke up and go nah but we
don't do we we wake up like ah we got away with it it's fine and then bam you get hit there's only two ways to learn
lessons hard and harder if you're if you're smart you take it the hard way real idiots take it the hardest way but
there's no easy way to learn lessons so you're right I agree with everything you say and that's and that's how God teaches anyway that's how God is always
going to teach cuz God is a disciplinarian love I think it says someone said this to me I think in school you learn things and then you're
given a test but with God you're given the test and then you learn things and that's the way it works that's why I was even in jail in the first place that's
what I was there for to learn that that's why I went you're being sharpened of course I'm being sharpened and it you
said earlier about me moving on to a new stage a new Evolution and I I hope that is true I hope that the 50-year-old
version of me thinks the 36-year old version of me was an idiot I think he's going to be a lot more calmer maybe yeah
but but I like to consider myself pretty smart so if I'm even smarter that's great we'll see how it goes maybe I will be calmer but it's all about reflection
and self-reflection looking back and that's what we were saying earlier but because most people do not self-reflect on their actions ever and you nailed it
with the with the reap what you seow and they don't understand why they end up where they end up and they think it's
someone else's fault they're like I can't get anywhere in life I'm like yeah cuz you work your 9 to 5 when you come home you smoke weed and play Playstation
why does everyone hate me cuz you do dumb [ __ ] and you make bad decisions people don't want people want the glory
but no wor oh you tell me about it yeah not just the glory and no work they want the glory and no heat I'll tell you
something man if you ever end up and I pray that you don't in a precarious legal situation you'll see all the
people who wanted to hang around you when you're famous and when you can get girls when you can go out and when you can pay bills all that they want to hang around for that but the second their
name gets brought up in this heat that you're in who they don't want the heat no people people want the good people
want the good without the bad hey man everybody has a Judas yeah tell me about it yep tell me about it and I and you
know what you said I pray I'm not in it I pray I'm in anything that God wants me to be a part of and you and and you and
What Do You Want To Be Remembered For?
and you'll survive cuz your mind's right yeah um your father used to talk about death a lot yep God forbid something
does happen to you yeah what do you want to be known for firstly I would never kill myself I
like to make that clear I would never kill myself oh okay I was about to say I'm like I never said you would but you're stating that just in case I would
never kill myself under any circumstances no matter what they say and I think I'll be remembered for somebody who was Brave because I know
the danger I'm in if I continue talk and when I say this just like when I used to say about the Matrix and how they lie to
us all during Co people didn't believe me I want people to understand the situation I'm currently in I am the most
popular person on the planet amongst the masculine youth which is the most feared demographic of any country of Any Nation
you need them heavily scoped for a few reasons one if a bunch of masculine youth get together it's not a
demonstration it's a revolution that's the first thing if women start complaining with picket boards is a demonstration if masculine youth get
together it's a revolution then you're dangerous cuz you don't even have a country correct all of them across the
country across the world so they probably thought you were a terrorist well I could be and that's what they're afraid of so let's let's continue so I
have the number one demographic The Matrix needs to S off one because of the Revolutionary thing two because you need them they're the backbone of the slave
Force you need them to build the roads you need them to do the real work for low pay they're the backbone of the SL
slave Force they do the worst hardest jobs for the shittest money and they're the most depressed and most unhappy and
then women don't want to date them cuz they ain't got a Lambo and they're sitting there depressed and unhappy working their ass off paying their taxes
you need those men scoped you don't want me coming along saying there's another way and and third you need them to die
in the military you need these people and I'm sitting here speaking to the exact people they don't want me speaking
to UK schools have banned me my name cannot be mentioned in school in the UK or you get detention you get punished my
name can't be banned Google Andrew Tate banned English schools in England if a child or a student says my name they are
reprimanded that doesn't make sense to me how is there so much garbage in the world that is legitimately evil and you
could talk about it let me give an example I don't think any man or woman should ever have the right to have their
voice be taken let me give you an example I love Jesus but if somebody came up to me flicked me off and be like f your God blah blah blah this is that
guess what hey man that's okay yeah you have every right to say that so how did you get how is it even
allowed well that's the thing so we go down this path we talk about how how is the how is the mass not seeing that
Being A National Security Threat, Assassination & Intentionally Being Canceled
that's a huge problem well this is the thing and this is why I talk about the fact that I'm afraid of assassination and some people think I'm exaggerating
I'm banned from being discussed in British schools they feel like my name
being mentioned in and of itself is detrimental and they banned my entire name the problem is this if I have huge
control over the masculine youth with the which The Matrix fear I'm banned from schools I'm dis TR in UK Parliament
as a problem you get to a certain point and there is a level you can reach which is considered a national security threat
you just said terrorism National Security threats do you know what happens once you're deemed a national security threat all bets are off yeah
you're they're going to murder you oh all bets are off if you're a national security threat they just shoot you if someone if a terrorist turns up what do
you do you shoot him right so I'm I'm teetering on the edge of national security threat and I'm trying very hard
not to I'm going on podcast and talking about God motivation doing the right
thing working hard respecting your parents loving your woman I'm TR I'm talking about all the good things but
I'm in this situation now where I'm so immensely popular when I was in jail people were started planning
demonstrations and riots and I from jail I was like no don't do that if people start burning buildings they're never
going to let me out yeah they're going to keep me in there forever like no just write emails happily like just stop
happily happily but but it's true you know it's it's scary but also you want to teach men how to do it the right way
and I I think when people are like we got we got to fight for this cause let's burn this lady's car to me that's that's
ridiculous of there's a there's a I don't know how we even got to a place where uh rioting is even a thing for to
get but this is another thing that's scary about power and influence right if I were to send a message on Twitter right now with a location and say I'm
going to be there in two days with no promotion no money I wouldn't have to build a sexy video nothing there would
be thousands and thousands of boys there is there one idiot probably is there one
[ __ ] I bet of course there is there's a more you you get a group of anybody you're gonna get one [ __ ] if that [ __ ]
does something wrong and he's been at my rally a few weeks before who fault is it dude I just said this and I got smoke
for saying this when Kai had his Meetup I wasn't angry at Kai but I was trying
to let them know that famous people nowadays have a little bit more access because we could just go straight to the
phone if you're in the '90s TV shows you watch them on the sitcom but now because we just dial right into your phone if
Kai goes hey I'm going to be in New York now he never said burn New York he never said break the cars he never took he
never told anybody to do that in fact he wanted to just show up and have a great time with the people that love him he had a great heart for it but he has to
take responsibility for that because none of those problems would have happened if he didn't tweet I'm going to
be there yeah and that's the thing right so you have that level of responsibility to a degree is scary and and Kai he's
young isn't he yeah he's young yeah but he's by the way great kid and people were getting so mad and saying that I'm
a huge fan of Kai I love his content I love his heart every time I see him he has a great smile he a great soul I
would just saying you have to be with great power comes what great responsibility okay that's right yeah no and you're completely right so then you
have to tie all that in so I I am scared about the fact that
someday someone's going to say you know what this guy's causing too much problems or he has too much influence can he just why can he just crash his
car can he just can he could his jet just crash can we just get rid of this guy because it fixes a lot of issues and
then you have to sit and say is my life worth more than the trouble I'm causing to these people they don't give a [ __ ]
about me they don't give a [ __ ] about anybody so you do get to a position where it's scary and then you have to sit and decide well do I want to sell my
soul to the devil and cuck or do I want to just shut up and disappear which is also cucking or do you want to live for
something and do you want to die as a name as opposed to a number and I've made that decision and I'll continue to do what I believe is best but I think
that also and I I want to say this here I think it's the first time I've said it I don't want to take to too much
credit but I do believe the Matrix is cracking I do believe now we live in a a
internet where you can say things you couldn't say two years ago where information is different pendulum oh it's swinging it's swinging and I feel
like I'm a huge part of that dude I'm not here to guess you up cuz then I just look like the guy is sucking up to you
again I there's a lot of things we disagree on so I'm not sucking up to you but I don't think anybody had the balls
that you had oh Absolut I went guns blazing at them at the Matrix and I said
I went Godless blazing at them and I said on an earlier podcast I said I this is a three-stage plan the N boys asked
me and they said you became the most famous man in the world you became the most Googled person on the planet every single Tik Tok video is you why did you
do this I said this is a three-stage plan stage one was to become the most known person on the planet and stage two was to get cancelled that's how you put
a crack in the dam for everybody to know who I am and then know I'm canceled and try and find me somewhere else and oh oh
[ __ ] so you wanted to get canceled to show that that doesn't even matter and I'm I'm now I'm bigger than never before
so technically did dude this song has been sung before when Jesus died and then came back well there's Al also and
by the way I'm not comparing you to Jesus I want everybody this song has also been this song has also been sung I
don't know if it was Aristotle or Socrates it was one of them who was assassinated for corrupting the masculine youth so this song has also
been sung one of them I can't remember which one was put to death because they said he corrupted the masculine youth because he told them not to join the
Army so it's scary right but part two was to get canceled because I believed
when I came up with this whole idea a when I sat there and I became religious because I realized there's so much evil
in the world God must exist you can't equal and opposite Force light has a
darkness and I see so much pure evil the devil must be real which means God must be real and I sat there and I decided
please remember before I became massively overtly famous I already had plenty of money I didn't I didn't need money I didn't need to do any of it when
I came up with my plan and I worked with the war room and we put together a one-year plan to become the most famous man on the planet and I pulled it off
and I did it and my plan was to get canceled and the reason was because I knew that the Matrix had the dam had a
bunch of pressure behind it everyone was tired of the censorship but when you get cancelled you vanish and I said there's
so much pressure behind the dam the crack it needs is for someone to get cancelled and stay relevant or become
more relevant than before then people won't be afraid of getting canceled anymore so then they'll start to talk
and when I got cancelled and I went moved to rumble and I put together the whole big Rumble thing and I put together my final message and I said my
unmatched perspicacity couple was sheer into fatigue makes me a feared opponent in any real of human endeavor and I sat down with Patrick pet David I said they
[ __ ] up they shouldn't have deleted me they sitting around thinking they've got rid of me they made a mistake and then
the Matrix got pissed off I got bigger so they threw me in jail which made me bigger so like all of this oh so maybe
that's why they don't want to assassinate you dude but that's the final solution I know but I shut up but
I shut up but think about all the people that get assassinated bro like they become Mars you know it's interesting I
won't say who but a very famous and very intelligent right-wing commentator said
to me when I was talking to him about all of this and he agreed with every single word I said he said the only way out is through you have to get so big
they're scared to kill you it's the only way or they're going to get rid of you if you stay in the middle you're going to go you have to get so big that
killing you will cause the problems they don't want you to cause alive do you ever think have you ever uh read job no
job is a man uh and the Devil comes up to him and he goes of course he worships you you gave him everything yeah yeah
and guy goes okay fine go test him but you can't take his life you can do anything you want ah this is I I do I think I carry on but I but you can't
take his life and he does and so the tactic is we got to remember that life
is held in God's hands not the devil's hands so this whole entire demons or
these Matrix or anything that they want as much as as powerful as we all think
they are yeah they only move when God wants them to move I agree with you and when I came to this industry my mom said
one thing cuz I was scared I was scared of the Illuminati I was scared all this stuff and my mom hit me with a refence
that had to do with my industry Y and she goes if God says action who has the authority to say cut I love that uh you
want to take a quick smoke break and then come back cuz I have to pee really bad and I haven't even touched my nose let's do it
okay oh God I drink so much water






honestly I'm not patient the devil getting frustrated the weed is making me
lazy a generation full of babies honestly I can't take just's a little
like uh uh thing that I wanted to say I thought it was just so funny uh I'm talking to Andrew uh via Twitter and I
go hey man is there anything you need from the states that I could bring to you you know I'm already coming and he goes AirHeads smiley face now
mind you bro learning about who you are and then you sending me AirHeads with a smiley face had me dying bro what is it
about AirHeads that you love so much bro they're just the best candy ever you were coming to visit me and you asked and I thought well let me you know
request some childhood happiness what do we say only women and children are happy right yeah trying to bring me
back uh so they don't kill you they're
you have the crack how do you feel about other influencers that walk in the footsteps of you but I
Andrew's Opinion Of Streamers Trying To Follow His Formula (Aiden, Sneako, Zherka, etc.)
feel like Miss or maybe they don't miss I kind of want to like ask you how do you feel about like the Aiden Rosses the
sneo zurka all of these people that kind of walk in the realm of where you want like neon is one now like how do you how
do you feel about these gentlemen I think they're all different people I don't pay attention to any of them um I
know something about I think I mean I don't want to insult anybody I don't want to talk about anybody negatively Zer is a
clown I mean dude no no no I'm not I'm not laughing because it's zura thing it just caught me so off guard listen I'm not
going to talk [ __ ] about anybody I'm going to be very respectful but [ __ ] that guy okay Z I mean I'm just trying to be
honest I I don't I I understand your question but I don't see myself as similar to any of them I think that oh
no I never said you're similar I think that they're trying to uh recreate your formula oh it's like the Krabby Patty
formul you know how Plankton sitting around be like how do they do it and then they're trying to do it but it's not really working yeah but they lack
substance they have no lessons to teach they have no life experience they are clowns and when you're a clown you
embarrass yourself for other people's entertainment I mean I don't want to Aiden I know well sneo I know well are
you close with Aiden yeah I speak to him Goin but but NE neom or whatever his name is he's a clown and Zer is a clown
I don't want to insult them too much but they're they're just children being St being stupid and and I think that as the
world devolves into Insanity people are looking for Solutions and answers as I said earlier which I can provide they
can't provide that because they don't have the life experience or the intellect or the capability so all they can do is provide cheap entertainment at
their own expense when you're a clown you embarrass yourself for other people to laugh yeah and and the Joker effect
yeah and and it's it's a completely different subsect but I do feel like there are some people
who are trying to follow in my footsteps and imitation is certainly the is flattering it was always going to happen
there was always going to be people who are trying to be me but there always one top G so it is what it is they're just
highlighting the more um insulting version of you than they are like they're not they're they're
they're your your your method is punch here's the knowledge and they're just punching for the clicks yeah and I think
there's thousands of people and there's probably thousands of influencers I've not heard of who are probably doing trying to do something similar or to C my formula or say the same kind of
things and yeah that's probably who are you closest with you know like social media real is it nelk is it Aiden is it
who who who do somebody you relate to and you could fully have a conversation and enjoy yourself you know what's interesting the N guys were super cool
and I've met a lot of guys and Aiden was cool met Aiden met sneo but you know actually really interesting I don't talk to anybody I I
I've realized this in fact there's a conversation about this inside the War Room a few weeks ago and we're talking about how a lot of influencers
cross-pollinate for views and stuff right they like I'll do a show with him and he'll do a show with me and then we'll go to his house we'll do a show
there and blah blah podcast is obviously different because it's a podcast show but outside of podcasts I don't meet
anyone ever if I I I can get a million views with me and Tristan in our home
with an iPhone I don't talk to anybody so I don't have conversations with anyone I don't meet anyone I'm far away I'm in Romania I can't leave I don't
really want them to come here I don't want to have to entertain them I'm I'm quite isolationist and my friends are
the same friends I had 20 years ago I don't have any new friends I don't talk to any new people I don't know if it's
because they're necessarily bad people as such but I just think we're on different paths different missions like I genuinely believe I'm waking up and
trying to make myself the most excellent version of myself I have the same standards for the people I love and my
children and my family and my women and I have the same standards for my fans I don't want any fan of Andrew Tate to
have ever lost in any realm this is the thing that's interesting I see these other influencers right let's say these other influencers some random influencer
comes along and he sells some random garbage a crypto and the crypto loses a bunch of money for
example I couldn't sleep at night knowing that my fans lost money because of me yeah I couldn't I I don't I don't
want money that bad I would rather all of my fans say you know what you can say what you want about Andrew tape but
since I listened to him my life has only gotten better nothing bad has happened to me I go to the gym I feel better I feel motivated I feel happier I'm I
joined his school it cost $40 it was cheap I'm making money now what's there bad about Andrew Tate every single thing
he he told me to do benefited me and I really think I'm on this path to Excellence and when I see all these other influencers and I don't want to
say names and I'm not throwing shade and I'm not trying to start internet beef because that's what they're going to try and do to trying to get clicks off my name because they're not relevant
without me and I don't give a [ __ ] about any of them just don't name them just yeah all these people what they're doing is the way they're acting doesn't
inspire anybody to be brilliant going in the street and yelling like an idiot running around with with half naked
girls and being entertaining and doing all this garbage they're doing nobody looks to that and goes I want to be a better man at at all they look at it and
they might laugh yeah they might think it's funny it might get views entertaining no substance yeah it's no substance and that's why I think my
brand is quite unique because it's very substance driven and the reason my brand is so substance driven is because I've
had such a difficult life I wouldn't be able to tell and teach the things I can unless God's put me through so much [ __ ]
I've been through a whole bunch of things so I can teach and tell the world look you can do this this way and life will improve you can be this kind of
person and your life will be better but I think all these other influencers and whatever else they're doing I think they're largely a part of the problem I
would like to think in other nations in other cultures and I don't know but let's look at China which has an
insulated internet if they have a brain and I've heard this is true I don't know if it is but they make sure that their
algorithms the people who become famous are musicians and mathematicians and
Engineers they don't allow their algorithm to promote the idiots because they want the youth to be inspired by
people who can do math extremely quickly or play the violin grade yeah that makes sense to me now it is the matric to a
degree of course is censorship and is governmental control yeah but we're doing the same thing but promoting the opposite we're promoting Insanity so
then you go down the rabbit hole why who what's the end goal why do we want
children to to wake up go on their phone and tune into a stream of some geek
loser screaming at the top of his voice in public who is doing this why are we
trying to dumb down the population and permanently distract them with absolute garbage because I I truly believe that
is you you talk about God and we talk about faith to be a disciplined religious
person the word is discipline it requires discipline it takes discipline to read the Bible it's not going to be
screaming kids it's not going to be flashing images it's not going to be as entertaining as a stream with 30 naked
girls no you're going to have to sit down pay attention read Focus reflect
try and find the lesson in the parable get confused read it again ask for help
you're going to have to study that takes discipline as we're destroying the new generation and removing their ability to
focus on anything removing their ability to be disciplined you're taking them from God most of the these children
Tik Tok Is Brainwashing Our Kids & America Being "Land Of The Free"
today are so messed up from Tik Tok they can't even focus on one page of a book
any book cuz all they do a scroll have you ever seen someone on Tik Tok how fast they change video yeah their minds
are gone you can't even sit them down and teach them anything whose fault is that hear me out is it the Matrix fault
or is it the parents fault well very interesting and I do think that parents certainly have a huge part to play
before it was the before it was the sorry interruptor but before it was this right before it was the phone say it was the school system yeah there was two
types of parents the one that dropped off the kids went met the parents uh met the teachers met the principal saw
what's going on put their toe in the water felt Alam to leaving their child
there yep and the other one was like see you later bye yeah yeah true so is this
just a different version of where we've been is there a matrix or is there just laziness I don't think there's
necessarily a matrix but then you have to look yourself and asked the question if a government's going to come along and say to a social
media company your social media product is designed to get people addicted and
as a responsible company not responsible competitive company you're developing your product to be as ruthless as
possible because that's what you're going to do yeah but we don't want you to say x y and Zed you're not allowed to
promote racism you're not allowed to promote hate speech you're not allowed to promote misogyny we do want you to promote transgender ideals we do want
you promote gender fluidity we do want you to promote um whatever else and never have a conversation about the fact
that maybe we want you to promote discipline and hard work and and these other things that's opposed to being a clown do why because they are they are
using these machines to promote garbage why don't they use it to promote anything constructive so check this out
we are in the land of the free H you don't agree with this of course not but let's debate about this is it free so
free that it's giving the will to anybody to do what they want and this is what the mass wants to do with it first
things first no country on earth is free not one next which country has the most
people in prison currently America which country has the highest percentage of its population in prison in history
America which country has the most laws I don't know that one America so
when you talk about the land of the free what they're actually saying is we've built a society based on freedom of
course there is no freedom because true freedom is anarchy so I'm not been advocating for it but that's what I'm
saying do you think turned that way because of that no no no but here's here's the here's the scop yeah every
single country has its own version of their restrictions and rules when I go
to the UAE I feel very free because I can say anything I want I don't want to
say the things that would land me in jail if I insulted Islam or insulted the
leaders of Dubai in Dubai I'd go to jail but I don't want to it doesn't cross my
my mind so I speak and feel free in America if you go to America and you talk Pro LGBT Pro agenda pro Democrat
Pro all these things you think you're in a free country because you're saying all the things you're allowed to say if you start saying the things you're not
allowed to say you'll learn that it's no more free than Saudi it's just there's a different set of rules of what you're
allowed to say so what we have please me please me make let me make this point
pertinently clear your ability to speak freely is direct directly correlated to
your insignificance when nobody listens to you you can say what you want if you get
a platform and start talking you will learn very quickly how you're not allowed to say what you want because
people are listening you're free to talk in an empty room you're not free to talk to millions of people who are paying
attention to you so what we have now in the west is a society which is only linked and only Bound by this false idea
of freedom because we don't no longer believe in a flag you look at at Russia all Russians respect Russia they all
respect the Russian flag they respect the Russian identity you can be Christian you can be Muslim but we are Russians and when they're attacked
externally they unify as a Russian people America doesn't have that half America hates the flag we they they've
turned the colors against each other they've turned the religions against each other they've turned the political parties against each other nothing
unifies nothing un divided it falls yeah house is divided at Falls nothing unifies America besides the illusion of
freedom so when you have the most controlled Nation on Earth with the most laws and the most people in jail and the
only thing that's preventing absolute Anarchy and unifying the people is the illusion of Freedom how do you do that
what you do is you make sure that nobody's free to do anything important like speak about important issues but
you allow people to be free to do dumb [ __ ] so you allow them to be as free as they want to chop their dick off change
their name change their pronouns and be clowns so then you could say we're a free Nation look how stupid this idiot
gets to act and you sit and say well I don't want to do that I want to talk about the educational system and I have
a large podcast and everyone's listening to me delete him ban him whoa whoa whoa whoa First Amendment no no ban him oh
he's still talking oh there's demonstrations jail I thought we're in a free country oh you are free you could chop your dick off but I don't want to
do that so the whole thing is a scam and only the Western countries even promote
this idea of freedom and it's a scam Freedom as I've just described whereas other nations don't do that Saudi Arabia
will not say we are a free country they will say we are God-fearing we are Islamic country we don't care about
Freedom we care about worshipping God and living true to God now I actually as a person like the rules I understand
even if I were to play a game I don't particularly like right even if I was in a situation even if I don't like the rules of life let's say you made me move
to some random country quala Lumar I don't know the rules of qual lmar but I
have to move there I even know what that is yeah but I have to move there and you give me the set of rules rules and I
read them I'll respect that what I don't respect is going to a country and reading the rules First Amendment
freedom I'm like oh cool and it's and then they and they get you it's a mirage it's a mirage so at least in other
nations you know the rules you wouldn't go to Moscow walking around with a [ __ ] Putin to you sure no no what see you
know the rules yeah so that's the biggest illusion that's going on so when you're talking about we have so much
Freedom absolutely and artly not sir I will disagree with you on that point there's no Freedom at all in fact there's less Freedom there is another place and you don't even know what
you're free to do anymore depending you can Riot if you're BLM but if you're the if you're the Republicans and you Riot
oo jail well I thought we could peacefully demonstr I thought we could demonstrate I thought we could protest it's a democratic company country right
no you can't protest anymore there's protest in France are all getting locked up it's it's all a mirage it's all
Society Must Be Ran By God Fearing Men
garbage what is now unifying the West because we don't even have God anymore and this is one of the things that's
interesting when you talk about Christian versus Islam ironic how everything started coming about when we did take God out of it completely but
now we have Christian nations and they don't feel Christian to me they don't look Christian I mean I
could walk around with a [ __ ] Jesus t-shirt in a Christian Nation I wouldn't do the same thing with an is in an Islamic Nation with the Islamic prophet
and I respect I wouldn't I wouldn't do it with an Islamic prophet in a Christian
Nation you're still toast yeah so they won't put up with it they won't put up with it so that's the thing that's so
interesting when you start to analyze people who are atheistic and go go stupid you don't need God they not even
smart enough to look at the big picture and realize without God there's nothing yeah you have nothing but Anarchy and
chaos and I tell you when 10 armed men turn up at your house and start raping your wife and putting a gun to your head
you wish God was there you'll be praying then Mr atheist Mr [ __ ] tough guy then you'll start talking about God and
it could have been prevented in the first place if Society was preserved if there weren't [ __ ] atheists like you
talking Godless that's what these clowns don't even understand without God there's nothing it's all a joke it it's
so it's perfect that you say that because every man knows God when he's at his lowest place oh they were they were
praying on that submarine woo they got the candles out
they had the little picture of Jesus like who's got a picture of Jesus anyone got a picture of Jesus a [ __ ] oh
my that was so you catch me with the left bro you catch me sometimes they were praying um
sir I forgot oh oh here it is here it is that was great uh I think we're this is
the thing that people don't understand and and mind you this is just me for reflecting tell me I'm wrong I want you to tell me if I'm wrong I believe every
man woman baby CH anybody were all designed to worship yep all of them y
now you could say I don't believe in God buddy that's your faith y you don't believe Y in God that's your faith so
you worship it you don't worship a God but you worship yourself Y and I think that's why they they feel the weight of
the world on them because God's like all right you don't want me to have it in my hands have it in yours yeah good luck yeah and it comes crumbling down and
then you start realizing that even your family could get evil and then you could get evil and your loved one can get evil
but then when you have boundaries and restrictions and rules and here's the best part I think wisdom truly is starts
and finishes with the fear of God absolutely same way if you have the fear of your father you respect your father
right AB you fear of disappoin absolutely no and it's so important what
you've just said because it's so profound and people at home need to understand it all humans are meant to worship and this is true the Godless
atheistic left-wing psychos worship the pride flag and abortion watch them look at them they worship it they go they
turn up they scream its name they try and promote it they worship it or you have famous men who will worship fame or
worship their girlfriend worship their wife if you believe in God you're not going to worship your wife you're going to respect your wife you're going to do
your very best to do good by her but you're you respect you worship God you're not going to allow a woman to trounce all over you you're like no
sorry we live Godless we live within certain boundaries within this house and we're a religious household and you're not going to do that otherwise we're not
going to be together anymore this is how it works we're a religious household yep but everybody worships something yeah
you by talking about being an atheist you think you're just showing the world how smart you are and that nothing's above you but it's absolutely notely the
opposite now you're showing that dumb shits above you you're worshiping Fame you're worshiping uh clicks likes money
some other person some human it's garbage it's crazy to me that um and
George's Sympathy For Only Fans Girls
like again I I I talk about only fans uh girls and and I and no disrespect to them and the reason why I have no
disrespect to them is because I believe that I was blessed with a with a home that teaches me about making decisions for my future and I can't point my
finger at a at a female or a man who's making decisions that they didn't have loved ones to tell them like hey don't
just plan for right now we got a plan for your future um everything starts in
the home yep and if you notice 90 or some crazy percent of people that are in prison they don't have a father yeah and
there's a lot of situations that stem from not having a good example in your life agreed so let's Circle back to the
home right we can't we can't control the government we can't control the Matrix we can't control the schools but we can
control what goes ins inside and outside of this home that's a very powerful powerful powerful thing that people are
not circling around but only if the man is the man of the house yes only if he is not feminized only if the Matrix has
not empowered the woman to the point where she thinks she's too good to listen to the man she's supposed to hey guys just a reminder that the merch
is out for a few more days so if you haven't got a chance to go to the heartof david. go ahead and click the link in my description or you could shop
on YouTube thank you guys so much and I hope you guys enjoy the rest of the podcast what is the foundation of a strong house well it's got be the man
and but it's the family unit men and women are different and they're supposed to work together and do different roles to come together and combine and become
the most powerful force if you destroy the roles if they no longer combine if they no longer fit together everything's broken which is what's happened in the
west now I actually find it fascinating and that's why I'm called called a misogynist by the way I'm called a misogynist for saying there should be a
man of the house because they're mistaking leadership with higher value they're they're mistaking leadership
with detriment and they're mistaking leadership with oppression and it's it's such a scop that they're doing because
they're coming along as s to women any man who says he's responsible for you and tries to guide you is oppressing you
and that's absolutely not the case in fact if you look at history most of the time it was the father who guided the
the daughter until the daughter got married and then her husband guided her that's how it's always been there's nothing wrong with that and women come
along and say we don't need no men's guidance we'll make our own decisions okay that's fine well let's look at the
let's look at the decisions you're making let's actually look at Western society and let's look at these women
without fathers and let's look at these women who don't listen to no man what decisions are they making are they good
for them are they good for society are they good for anybody I said something that got me in a lot of trouble a long
The World Would Be A Better Place If Women Walked Around With Their Body Counts On Their Forehead
time ago and I'm G say it again I said please I'm not good at learning my lessons what did I say about driving
until you hit the tree what did I say okay go ahead I said the world would be a much better place if women had to walk
around with their body counts on their foreheads oh I remember you got smoked for everyone lost their minds but not
because they're like he's a misogynist because they're too stupid to extrapolate because I say something
abrasively to shock people and the intelligent ones will look at what I say and extrapolate the lessons from it like
we talk about the Bible you read the parable but you have to sit down and analyze what it actually mean I'm talk female promiscuity women to be
moreful Andel with who they slept with this would INSP mascul Excellence now you can't be a loser with a little bit
of weed and get a chick over the house you have to be a better version of a man you have to be the kind of man who can provide for her if she gets pregnant for
to even consider sleeping with you because that number is going to go up and she's going to be judged for it and women don't like being judged women are
very very susceptible to societal pressure and peer pressure and judging same with men same with men but women even more because men are not going to
want to be with a girl who has 468 number 100% so now men are going to get men are like I want a low number she
doesn't want to add to her number I better be better I better be better now when someone gets together they're going
to stay together they don't want to mess up their numbers right they're going to stay together they're going to stay together as a family they're going to be
more prepared to sit talk through things work things out no longer divorce anymore the church holds this Islam
holds this absolutely because in Islam and in Christianity when you go to church or you go to the temple right what are the main thing that they fear
is God but they also fear how other people are looking at them 100% when my mom used to come to church go hey don't
embarrass me around these people so I had to behave about all right I don't want to represent my family the wrong
way completely peer pressure can go positively as well as negatively so when I said this I got attacked vom misologist but no one understood what
I'm actually talking about is couples coming together working together masculine excellence and removing promiscuity from society so that you get
to a point where a lot of problems are fixed what did you just say about prisons and fatherless homes wouldn't having that number on a woman's head
fixed the fatherless homes now we fixed the prison population you can extrapolate this out towards fixing the entire Society
but I make the point and nobody listens to what I say they just they just lose their minds because they're emotional but it's no but it
is but but it's amazing how you can extract out from that one point I made but you could have made the same point
in a loving way I could have that's what I'm saying bro so then we have to ask why I don't yeah that's the thing bro
because I think that's your next Journey because I think you're I think this is what happened you knew step one was to
get famous and the only way to get famous is to piss people off I did pretty good you did you did hey you did a fantastic job thank you sir okay your
next season now is to group in the rest of the sheep yeah of course and and I think and I say sheep in a good way
trust me it's a biblical term uh I think right now you need to win the hearts of
some females that disregard you completely because I had this conversation with my girlfriend and my girlfriend's like Hey listen he says
this he says that I go okay you got to think about what they're going so we had to sit down and watch a podcast and they
like baby's trolling here and she goes well I don't understand that he's trolling here why would he be trolling here why is he talking so serious here
yeah but then he's joking around here of course so I think honest to God I really do I think your next journey is going to
even be bigger because now you're going to have to figure out a way to talk to other people without pissing them off
and I can and I can do it for this episode explain to me in a way that you get the same result of the numbers thing
like school without using the numbers thing what what could we do to get women to use their numbers lower without
disrespecting them and saying hey go outside and and put your number up of course and just the point I'll make I
don't think it's disrespectful I think it was just a thought experiment but I understand what you're saying I can say it in a far easier way do you know why I'm doing this by the way of because I I
I want to vouch for you and I want to vouch for Trump and I want to vouch for people that I do believe in but it's
really [ __ ] hard when you're going around saying these [ __ ] need to have [ __ ] numbers on their head and I'm
like [ __ ] D stop saying that you know what I mean like I'm trying to vouch for you so if I have to come out
here and and literally come out fly out here 15 something 16 hours I want to sit here and say dude I am with you but I'm
trying to be with you waving my morals and my Integrity I'm trying to bring in even the people that we think are stupid
they're still worth saving oh completely understand and I and I'm also very prepared and aware that I can say things
in a far nicer way I I agree with you it's not accidental I am aware of it you already achieved what you needed to
achieve yeah and and that's why I said it's something I said a long time ago but I was just explaining the point behind it a strong message so how do we
get that message out without pissing them off oh that's easy I mean I think when you tell a woman but you know what
it's interesting it's really interesting and I want to make this point there is a very vocal minority especially on on the
internet of feminists and leftwing psychos I'm telling you if I say to a
woman being promiscuous is disgusting 95% of women go yes it's only these 5%
of idiots you see going I can do whatever I want I'll sleep with a hundred guys if I want and then we sit
and go all women think that way women are not actually as broken as Society is showing them to be on the internet thank
God they're not that bad because trust me most women know that in fact women know that so intrinsically in their
hearts if you see a woman insult another woman what does she call her a [ __ ] slag it's the first word out of her
mouth you [ __ ] it's the first thing women do because women know that's how you insult a woman so even the bad women
who run around having arguments with other women who are promiscuous themselves use promiscuity as an in
so most of the world actually understands this it's only the Western World which has this very broken vocal
minority and these people always come to terms and learn that they were wrong as they were older it's just unfortunate
they have to learn the hardest possible way I don't think there's any woman out there except with 100 guys who's happy she's done it it's sad she got scoped by
Society she probably had no dad at home no masculine role model no one guided her she got scoped by Society into
thinking that having sex with men is somehow going to be empowering and she's woke up one day and looked in the mirror and she hates herself I was at a I feel
sad for her I was at a party once at my friend's house and they always make fun of me for this but I was a very uh uh
learning curve for me yep I'm sitting there and all my friends are having fun and I'm noticing that this girl's
behavior is trying to impress the men that's around her yeah and she starts trying to do drugs and I looked at her
and I go sweetheart and by the way that's dangerous right calling a girl sweetheart now is very dangerous and and
it never come like my father I have to tell him chill because be like sweetheart honey and I'm like yo yo chill you can't say that [ __ ] no more
and it's so heartbreaking cuz my father looks at them like their daughter yeah you know and and so just know if I did
say sweetheart I was looking at it from the eyes of my own father so I go sweetheart you don't have to do that yeah and she lost her [ __ ] mind on me
and she started freaking out everybody's like y you can't say that blah blah blah is and that right okay she freaks out leaves and she says something that broke
my heart the man was like listen you got to go you're freaking out you're causing a problem they're not going to kick me
out right they're not going to kick me out yeah but they're going to kick her out and the thing she says she goes no no no it's fine I'll suck
your so right there I realized that she was put in positions to realize that
that's her way out y That's Her value she can offer broke me okay the next day
I asked the gentleman I go hey man what happened to that girl he goes dude I'm going to be honest with you I haven't heard from her and I'm trying to hear
from her I'm freaking out so my heart drops I go hey if that girl killed
herself I'm going to really really it's going to take me a lot to get out of that because I'm going
to know that that weight was on me and then I start going back should I pulled her aside should I done this is and that
finds out she put herself in rehab it took one person wow to question
wow what she was doing y for her to question Y what she was doing yep if you
feel like somebody you love or your neighbor is doing something that you know in your heart hey man like you
don't need to be doing that we we've been put in positions to be like don't be that guy y but be that guy because
you have no idea how catastrophic her life could go off on if
you just asked her one [ __ ] question that's right hey man what are you doing yep you don't need to do that peer
pressure can work positively also that's why I circled back to that and it's actually very interesting because when somebody knows you're right and they
know they have a problem or they know they've been wrong they usually react with with anger that's why she got so angry cuz she knew you were right she
was Defensive she was Defensive I realized that the wom do that the most I do that the most and by the way I'm a very feminine guy I know that I grew up
with like a sister I have a lot of girls around me during Co I was locked up with six girls I thought that was the coolest thing in the world turns out so
sensitive afterwards everything was hurting my feelings everything you are who you hang out with bro you how many
times i' be like how dare you and then I was like all right I need to chill the [ __ ] out you know what I mean like like I I I always wanted to conversate about
[ __ ] like how do you [ __ ] feel about like and like you I realized maybe his feelings don't matter and I need to move the [ __ ] on uh but I find that really
Andrew's Advice To The Boy Who Didn't Grow Up With A Father Figure
funny uh okay so we Circle back to the leader of the house okay what else is the foundation of a good home how can a
man who doesn't have a father who's made mistakes who who hears your voices now you move the anger can now properly
understand the language of love that you're coming from a loving place he understands what's his first step well I
believe in actionables in fact actionables is probably the word I type the most on my phone actionable yeah may
maybe if I press a actionable comes up because when someone tells me anything my answer is actionable so they come
along and they say Andrew the is attacking you they're deciding they're going to print a new story saying you've done XY Z and you're going to be accused
of XYZ I don't like oh my God that's terrible why would they do that pointless completely actionable what do
we do about it what can we do about it if nothing can be done then let's just put it in the this is going to happen
bank and let's consider it for future moves and let's stop talking about it if something can be done what can be done
who's going to do it how long is it going to take all I care about is actionables so when I talk to people at
home I have all these young guys I get thousands of emails a day thousands of DMS a day people go to my website
cake.com they message the live chat all day every day looking for help how do I sit and try and explain the very nuanced
and complicated subjects of life and masculinity to 16-year-olds who I've never met in a nation that might be
completely different to mine geographically politically and socially and I believe you do that by giving them actionables giving them things you can
do so I sit here and I say and when I preach the things I preach I want be people to understand why I've chosen them I don't think anyone's life will
get worse if they train hard and get stronger I don't see how your life can detriment from that maybe maybe you
could find some extreme scenario but as a general rule to everybody go gym
you're a weakling go get strong yes I think that's a good General Point same
thing so first is to fix your temple first point absolutely the first point is to improve your body that's the first thing you can do so when you're asking
me the man who has no father and he wants to live a good righteous life inside of his home I don't don't know
all of his background I don't know his capabilities I don't know his mental state I don't know where he lives I don't know anything but I know that if
he gets stronger he'll stand a better chance of doing it because you also learn mental discipline by doing that
which is also a good thing to learn when I teach people saying listen you need to go become as rich as possible the reason
I'm doing that is not just so that you make money which is the time and energy of other people it's also all the lessons you'll learn along the way
you're going to learn how to manage people manage staff manage stress you're gonna learn how to talk confidently and
go to meetings you're going to learn how to be organized and on time you're learn how to be punctual you learn a bunch of
things if you learn how to make money so I say you need to go get as much money as possible and become as strong as possible because I believe if you do
those two things and start to succeed in them you can extrapolate and take all of the lessons from those two things and
apply it to anything including a relationship it takes discipline for a relationship takes commitment for a relationship Tak people go lazy when
they get a relationship absolutely so if you're a disciplined person who always goes to the gym if you're good at managing stress and controlling your
temper from high pressure business meetings both of those things will apply to your relationship and make you better
at running a household 100% so that's why I teach the two things I core teach I in fact I teach three things but I
teach well even the body just a circle back uh you have muscles like you see that did you ever feel pain from growing
those muscles absolutely it hurts so that's also a factor of it and I agree with you I think a lot of people uh that
feel like that that once they take themselves from I feel like [ __ ] to like oh I so [ __ ] great they realize they
could put that energy other places yeah so I agree with you yep and the third thing I teach which I think is extremely
important in lacking in the world today is Brotherhood I think that men have always kept men accountable you just
talked about living in a house with six women and how it changed you imagine you lived with six Warriors destroyed me imagine you lived with six men who were
training for UFC fights imagine the dude dude no so this happened I swear to you this happened I
was I told God I go God I I reflected this is a problem randomly one of my
friends from Chicago this [ __ ] is Deep In the Ghetto of Chicago so when
I mean a man like you look at he's 65 you look at him the wrong way he'll eat you yeah the energy he has is I'm going
to get it done my word's my word yeah and I'm going to be at the gym at this time and be there blah blah okay he came
in the gym guess what I can't miss gym no more that's right why what the [ __ ]
wrong with you that's right I was up at 600 you slept until 1200 you can't go to the [ __ ] gym and now I'm sitting here being like yeah he's [ __ ] right I
probably should be in the gym so it does push me it it it it keep you know what we need we need um I I love uh when when
I play I'm sorry I'm losing the word but when uh competitiveness I love being competitive
absolutely masculine accountability and you know what else is is with men because men are different than women you
talked about how you lived with women they were all talking about feelings Etc you know what's a fantastic motivator for men shame I'm telling you now it
works shame if I if I'm around my house and someone was getting fat and all of us to go you're a fat [ __ ] what you
eating that for I guarantee they'd train shame works with men and you talk about
this and this is the reason I promote Brotherhood the reason I am the man I am is not just because I'm so fantastic it's because I even now to this day live
with six men I live with my fight coach I live with my brother I live with some my old friends have had for 20 years we live in this big ass compound this huge
house if I wake up and my brother's been training an hour and a half I feel so annoyed and angry and guilty that I have
to go and beat him now so that competitiveness Keeps Us constantly at Edge people say me and Tristan me and
Tristan are best friends and our Brotherhood is fantastic but it is based on competitiveness but we don't compete against each other we compete to prove
to each other we're a good teammate in the battle against the Matrix how do you get there how because I've seen a lot of
men get torn up by that yeah so how do you how do you get to a healthy way where we're competitive but it's not going to destroy our relationship well
you have to understand that there's enough outside enemies you have to put your ego aside and say look there's enough people who already want me dead
we're the same blood can't we at least unite against all the people who want me dead I want you I'm in competition with
You Tristan I want you I want to beat you to prove to you I'm a fantastic
teammate to you as opposed to I want to beat you because I don't like you and it's a different mentality and we'll sit
there and my brother and I are in constant endless competition but it keeps us sharp so masculine competition is super important which is why it's the
third thing I teach which is Brotherhood you are the some of the Five People You spend the most time with if you find some guys who have their game right your
game's going to get straight it's as simple as that and I think if you take any man on the planet in any situation
in any scenario and you tell him to become as strong as possible because of all the lessons he's going to learn
become as rich as possible because of all the lessons he going to learn plus obviously being strong and Rich are benefits plus find a network of
Brotherhood of men who are accountable to themselves and by extension accountable to you if you're accountable
to yourself as a man you're also accountable for your friends I don't want loser friends I don't want [ __ ] friends if I had a guy I really liked
and you start being a [ __ ] I'd try very hard to fix him and if I couldn't fix him I wouldn't be his friend anymore I'd say stop that we don't do that why
are you doing that what are you crying about again why are you acting that way come on let's go train I don't want to
train but we always train come on let's go and then after a while I'd be like he doesn't train anymore get him out bye go
go go get eaten by Wolves that's the unfortunate reality of the world because I'm the some of the five people I spend the most time with I don't want to wake
up one day feeling terrible and going ah but he's missing the day and I might miss today he'll his poison will get in
my brain I have to resist it so if you get a Brotherhood masculine Brotherhood and you're accountable for yourself and
for them you're going to be able to do nearly anything I've conquered the whole world with those three things all I do
is train as hard as possible try and make as much money as possible and I have men around me doing the same thing you train every day every single day
seven days a week you don't give yourself a rest zero don't believe in rest I rest expain I rest when I'm
asleep I rest when I'm sleeping okay you explained it thank you you go so [ __ ] quick I didn't like he's sharp dude he

George Tells Andrew What His Biggest Struggle Is
sleep very late I'm going to I'm going to be vulnerable I'm going I'm going to give you my problems and see like just beat me to death with them and figure
out all right let me sit up straight okay um I I took on accountability right for
those other things that I was dealing with made me gain weight depressed couldn't uh I had a problem saying no
and I had a problem walking away from people that I love y handled that right now there's this thing on my table it's
called marijuana okay okay uh I'm addicted I have an addictive personality but I use it to my advantage because if
I'm addicted to something and nobody else could tell I've never had a problem with it because I've never had something that was bad for me because everything
that I've ever wanted was good for me and that's good to carry me through those days that I don't want to do it cuz I'm addicted to it I'm just like
hammering it out um marijuana for me is my brain cuz my brain just goes off so
at night I like to unwind and smoke a little bit um I'm scared that it took over my life where I can't even like if
I go one day without it I have gone a few days without it because I can't even smoke here and it doesn't affect me anymore that way but
I it's my dad said this he goes you have a problem with moderation should I just
give it up completely marijuana completely just go through the [ __ ] of it get rid of it or should I teach
myself moderation with it well then I also don't have any like I don't drink I
don't go to clubs I never even like going to clubs when I was single it just doesn't entertain me I don't have like an outlet I don't even smoke cigars but
I'm opening up a cigar lounge with my dad in Arizona Shout Out 24 Street a cigar lounge that's actually pretty cool
but I don't even [ __ ] smoke I did it to honor my Dad it's me and my dad's thing okay smoking is the only thing where I can hang back and just [ __ ]
chill dude should I feel guilty about this should I get rid of it how do you feel about it it's an interesting question but then you have to analyze
what you're doing it for because even the reason you just described to me would put me off doing it because we're obviously different people but you said
it stops your brain working at a th miles an hour yeah that's a that's a gift why would you want to turn your brain off think of all the thoughts you
haven't had think of all the things you could you haven't done that you could have done why do you want to relax and chill so badly why don't you want your
brain working on Optimum efficiency all the time why don't you read the dictionary learn another language why don't you start another business why do you want to chill I I that's the first
thing you don't chill dude never so that's the first thing you have to do is analyze [ __ ] first thing you analyze is you don't chill before bed never what do
you do before bed I'm working to the second I fall asleep no shot no I'm like I'm like one of those toddlers Who falls asleep halfway through I just I don't I
don't think oh it's late I better sleep no if I'm awake I'm awake until I'm like I really can't stay awake and then I'll fall asleep and I I and a cigar doesn't
doesn't affect you that way no I can smoke to the second I go to bed and I'm just instantly out I mean a cigar I I don't smoke cigars I actually smoke
cigars because nicotine is good for your testosterone level and I do not take steroids that's why I smoke nicotine is good for your testosterone correct
that's why I smoke a lot of cigars so I smoke a lot of cigars and do a lot of cardio so that my lungs why don't you do steroids I don't do steroids cuz I've
never done them in myti life I was drug tested throughout my whole career and I'm now 36 and I don't do them and my testosterone level is still huge it's
still very high it's that absolute upper limit of of the natural you just don't need it so I don't need it but if you
needed it would you be Pro for it or not I mean maybe if I get old old which is testerone testosterone replacement
therapy but I don't I've never taken drugs and I don't like people who take steroids and I'll tell you why it annoys
me because I look like a much bigger monster if everyone else wasn't on steroids it'd be cooler it pisses me off
I've done it the hard way and they're all just juicing so so I don't take steroids but you've never smoked weed no
never tried a drug in my life and is that cuz you're scared of it because you have an addictive personality or like is it because if I try cocaine and I don't
like it I'll regret trying it if I try cocaine and I do like it I'll start doing cocaine and I'll regret trying it damn so why my man reflected on that so
why do cocaine so never tried cocaine I've never tried weed never tried a pill never tried ecstasy never take a I've never tried anything besides uh I've
drinken alcohol and I smoke cigars that's it but so your your alcohol is like my marijuana then I quit alcohol a
year and a half ago so what the [ __ ] how would you even bring it up I got so excited I used to I used I used to drink alcohol and I haven't drinken alcohol
when did you drink though when you're unwinding no I used to drink because
uh a year and a half ago I quit alcohol cold turkey instantly were you like a
drunk or were you just like absolutely not I was extremely effective it was at the time when I was most famous I was
doing elk boys I was drinking alcohol when I had all those things on Tik Tok when I first blew up everything I used to drink alcohol all the time and I used to probably drink every day cuz I have a
lot of money and I have a fun life and we jump on the jet we drink vodka and we get off and be all these girls we go to the club we drink Vodka you just drink I
didn't never had a problem with it never suffered with it never got out shape from it it was fine and then I decided
I'm going to live many different versions of reality and I spent a year now partying basically every day and it's been great but I want to live a sober life and see what happens so I
just instantly quit I blinked and cured my brain I could quit smoking instantly if I decided I could blink and cure my brain I could just do this so but to
answer your question which you initially asked the first thing is what you've told me marijuana does for you I don't
understand why you want it because here's the thing I I want to unwind it is my time to unwind so for example if
I'm playing unwind when you're asleep but I'm playing fortnite what the [ __ ] do I need my brain for for to win to win
it's a battle you have to destroy your enemies what do you mean to sit there and just lose do you do you play video
games yet or no sometimes when I was on house arrest I started playing Super Smash BRS what about fortnite no I don't
play fortnite no okay would you ever drop in with me only if I listen if I start playing fortnite and I Lose I'm
going to end up being the best fortnite player on the planet and I've got more construct cuz I can't take the L and I've got more constructive things to do
with my time Dr it once in the B bro no I can't do it we'll play we'll play Super Smash BRS I'll get Kirby and I'll
beat your ass I don't know what Super Smash I'm not that little piece of gum is going to mess you up it's like the Airhead just fear fear this picture cuz
it's coming for you what is a gum you don't know what Kirby is no bro you're smoking too much
weed what anyway what weed does for you I don't know why you want it that's the first thing second thing I'll say is
this I don't know whether you should quit or not I appreciate you being honest I don't but the fact that you struggle to
understand whether you could or not I believe is a problem so for me right should I quit cigars well I don't think
so maybe I should maybe I shouldn't whatever but I know I could without a single drop of hesitancy I could
instantly quit so you should know I forgot to mention one important thing sure uh when I was in high school never
touched it because I was I was trying to get to where I was yeah High School I mean College I don't know how you like
this what do you mean bro I'm so glad I don't like it cuz it's not [ __ ] that brand oh god there so much like uh taste
flavor Brilliance sure excitement I want this out of my mouth e numbers College I never had the party
thinge I never did out that [ __ ] uh I feel like right now in my life I have no kids uh I don't I'm I'm I don't have
like certain things where I need my brain to be on 24/7 I know when I have kids there's no shot I'm going to be
able to do that yeah I see a good window of opportunity and I'm just scared that one day when I'm like waking up at 3:00
in the morning cuz I have kids or like all the [ __ ] I'll be like I should have enjoyed my time where I was like less responsibility uh this is why I smoke
now because I know there's going to be a time as soon as my mind goes there I'm going to be able to walk away and I've also in the past few years I'll give
myself 60 to 90 days off to make sure I'm not addicted to it so I've already trained my body to like so could you
quit now instantly if you decided to 100% I've done it many times okay well then then you have then you don't have that big of a problem so if you could
quit then it doesn't matter but if you were to sit and go I don't know if I could quit then you'd have to quit okay now I have the most important question
What's Your Opinion Of Bottom G?
of the day sure how do you feel about bottom G um cuz dude dude if you got up and
danced like that man I think you would I think everybody would just agree with you I think that's what would happen I think everybody in the world would be

People Who Go To Festivals Are Dorks & What Andrew ACTUALLY Does For Fun
what's your fun what do you do for fun but this is a question so now let's look at this okay what let me ask you go what
is fun fun is when you're tell me something fun something fun I think this
is fun EXA this is work true okay fun okay fun is when you're having a lot of
joy and less work but what if you have Joy during your work I do have joy when I work so do I I love working all I do
is work and people say why do you mean all you do is work because there's there's nothing else to do anyway the
only time I'm not working is if I'm fighting which you can still consider work because I consider it training or
sometimes I'll drive one of my 53 cars in a circle I'll go out racing around the mountains in a Ferrari but I'll film it all and it'll end up be on the
internet so it'll end up being work yeah so what do I do that's not work that I enjoy I mean I look at people who are
having fun and those are the people who I don't believe are chasing Pride or chasing happiness and I feel like they're wasting their lives trying to
have fun trying to be happy is the biggest waste of life you know what I saw the other day it's it's remarkable
you're not going to believe this I saw thousands of people take drugs and stand close to each other in a big sweaty pit
like a bunch of peasants and jump up and down listening to a song they could listen to on YouTube for free and they paid money to do it it was called a
festival and it was disgusting and I see these humans stand there I'm like what the [ __ ] is no
wonder you're [ __ ] broke broke you're an idiot you're you're dumb as [ __ ] you're a [ __ ] like festivals are crap
concerts are crap clubs are crap what's fun nothing's fun the only thing that's fun is masculine achievement and being
respected for being monumentally successful and competent and crushing your enemies with your Brut brutal
Brilliance turning up and saying I'm going to make more money than all of you I'm going to be more famous than all of you I'm the best watch me and winning
that is fun and then the only techically that's video games but you're doing in real life again in real life I have no time for games house AR rest be found a
few hours now I'm back out here in the real world everyone must pay the price but even then the only things that I find fun now the only thing I do for fun
is okay I'll take my sf9 around cirle that's a $700,000 car my fund's expensive I need a lot of money to even
find anything I find remotely entertaining a beautiful friend of mine she's in Bali and she's like I can't
wait till her free we're going to go to Bali look at this Villa I'm like if I went to that Villa do you know what I would do I was like what are you doing there she's like I'm doing yoga and I
had breakfast and I'm looking at the forest and we're go see the monkeys said if I went to Bali do you know what I'd do I'd sit on my laptop I would turn up
at the Villa and go which room's mine okay laptop coffee please coffee laptop
it'd be the same as Romania in Bali and when I go to Dubai it's the same that's
what I do I work and I want to make this very clear to people because I find it amazing when people say they don't have
motivation I have people come to me and say I want to get rich I don't have motivation I want to work harder said how can you not have motivation to get
rich when somebody like me with a head start like mine is still working 18 hour days every single day seven days a week without having a day off I'm going to
crush you you don't stand a chance I will beat you and you're just going to sit there and perpetually lose because
you can't find the motivation to crawl up out the mud and stay a bug until you end up in your 15minute city getting your 17th injection like a dummy like a
useless eater all I do is work nothing is fun I don't have fun I don't even
understand Sports I don't understand the concept of fun the only sport where I ever did was beating the [ __ ] out people
is that fun why did you get into fighting because I was a chess player and chess and fighting are remarkably
similar very you have to know what your next move is going to be countering his next move and there's no luck if you
lose you made a mistake there's no such thing as a lucky punch if if I'm losing a fight or if I'm beating some guy up
and he hits me with one shot and knocks me out and people go that's a lucky punch he's trained his whole life to punch people in the face and he punched
me in the face you call that lucky I'll call that good I think it was a very good punch excellent probably his best punch of his career no such thing as
lucky punches same thing with chess if you L also you left your guard down absolutely it's my fault same thing with chess
brutal self-accountability if you lose you made a mistake somewhere how do you learn that you have to go back reflect you have to watch the game back play the
game back where did I make the mistake you don't blame your opponent you blame yourself always in chess it's
self-accountability so when I stopped playing professional chess I decided to move over to fight because they're very similar it's one-on-one it's not team
sport so that's why I chose to fight but I never considered fighting fun I never took it as hahaa this is fun I was out
to hurt people for real so I can't think of what I do for fun or any fun I've ever had I am of course human I love
sitting around with my boys and laughing I don't think there's any higher experience for men than sitting around
with your boys having a laugh and having a joke I think that's as good as life gets you can have a billion dollars like me or you can be at the bottom but if
you're with five people you truly love your guys and you've been with them and you trust them and you're smoking a cigar or not and you're sitting around
telling stories and everyone's laughing that's as good as life gets at the top of the bottom on jet or on the jet or or
home in the in the in the trenches it doesn't matter what yeah on the jet all you do is that and and at the bottom all you do
is that so that's as good as life gets anyway so I I'll consider that fun I
mean I guess I do like road trips I like to drive around Europe from Spain to France
to Italy and are you allowed to do that now not now last summer we got a bunch of Ferraris together 10 Ferraris and we
raced all across Europe and that was fun but we film it all so it's still kind of work but yeah I don't even but you put
yourself in a position where all your fun could be wor of course but my point is I don't don't understand or I don't
fathom the concept of fun I don't wake up and think what can I do for fun I
don't wake up and think what is fun I want fun that never crosses my mind I
wake up and think I have things to do and if I don't have things to do I'll find things to do you can always do more
work you could there's no such thing as no work to do after this podcast is done
you can release it and you can make X amounts of Clips that's going to be done and then you could watch it back and you
you could analyze every word you've ever said and you could find a way to say it differently you could look at a dictionary and find new words and you could learn them and you can memorize
them all then you could sit down and you could rehearse it and use those words and sentences to make sure you pronounce them correctly and you don't make any
mistakes then you could always do more work from the same thing the work is never ending the money is never ending
so you have to find joy in your work you have to find purpose at least I don't know if I even find joy in my work because I'm stressed and annoyed I'm
furious all the time what do you mean we've made $1.3 million today it's a joke
God Put The Desire To Conquer In Every Man's Heart
flip the computer but it's it's you have you have to conquer the Earth why why
let's talk about this why did genas Khan wake up and think you know what what can
I do for fun well I can play this instrument that [ __ ] play the instrument for me boring okay let me [ __ ] this girl
[ __ ] her let me [ __ ] her oh kid number 84 boring what's s do you know what you know what guys let's all get our horses
and let's just ride over there and who whatever we find let's just take it why because it's the instinct to
conquer it's inside of a man it's been dumbed B Down By The Matrix they try and numb you they numb you with
entertainment they try and put you in the festival crowd they numb you with [ __ ] food they numb you with depression
all this other garbage but truthfully if you're a man you look in the mirror what will make me happy my Empire will make me happy that's why Alexander the Great
did what he did and Julius Caesar did what he did and genas Khan did what he did they didn't have Google Maps they didn't know where they were going they
said no no we've decided we're going to go take [ __ ] from other people and show we're the best and that's what we're
doing now the successful men at least in a financial sense why am I making money I have nothing to buy there's nothing to
buy I have it all I have four kernin eggs a rimac a Bugatti 53 other cars 40
properties there's nothing to buy I'm just taking it from other people I'm winning the game I'm conquering and
that's what I think truly is going to give you purpose in life it's just Conquest men have always been this way that's why war was even happening in the
first place the Mongols raided Vienna how long does it take to ride from
anulan Batar Mongolia on a horse to Vienna Austria across all of
Siberia and they were still mad enough and bored enough to go now we need that City over there that's the masculine
Essence and it's been numbed down inside of people do you think they were ever considering fun at any point during this Conquest cuz I don't think they were
well do you think they were just trying to dominate others I don't think is about trying to dominate I think that inside of every single man there's a a
god-given I think that the entire world was built by this god-given drive to
conquer and to conquer doesn't always mean dominate others you can conquer the Sky by building a skyscraper you can you
can conquer by building roads you can conquer by construction not only by destruction you conquer by turning up to
a new territory and having a beautiful family and creating children I think that's inside of every single man I think it's been dumbed down by the
Matrix but I'm uninterested in fun I don't understand the concept of fun fun is for women and children all the women
around me have fun last night last night I went to a restaurant my brother and I
three or four friends maybe 25 of the most beautiful women you've ever seen in your life we sit down at this table all
this fancy food comes all these bottles of champagne come everyone comes the girls are laughing drinking everyone's
having fun never at any point during the entire experience did I have any fun I
sat down on my phone checked how much money I had
again did some work replied to important people spoke to my fight coach about
training and important things spoke to the War Room about important things in Conquest spoke to my legal team everyone
around me is having fun I'm getting things done looks like I'm having fun but never did I ever for a second feel
fun and I didn't want to I didn't try and join in the fun I didn't try and go yeah yeah no I pay for at all you all
have fun I'm going to do this and I say this there's a I say this all the time to the people I care about your life is
fun and my life is stress but you are mine that's how it works you're my woman
so you're allowed to have fun and my life is going to stay stress but you are mine I have my fun via proxy by making
sure everybody I love have fun I don't want any fun so you have fun in providing I provide fun but I don't have
any fun I don't even have fun in providing fun it's just my obligation everyone around me has fun
I'm working and I cannot explain does Tristan have the same mindset of this or does he like to have more fun he likes
to have a little bit more fun than I do you might I can see that he looks a little bit happier but it's not happy this is the point I want to make this
very clear to the people at home I don't want anyone at home to think that I'm unhappy or depressed or miserable from this I this is just how I view the world
I don't I don't want to have fun I don't know how else to say it I don't look at
fun and go I'm missing out I look at fun and going I'm glad they're enjoying they're fun it's like food do you want
this cake no everyone else wants it I'm glad they want the cake cake tastes good it's great but I don't want the cake I
want something else I will provide the cake I'm a baker I can give you cake but
I don't want any I don't think in the concept of fun I don't enjoy fun ever all I want to do is monumentally Achieve
endlessly that's all I'm interested in so we went to your past we figured out why why you were built like this um we
talked about the dilemma and the obstacles that you've overcome we talked about moving into the next season what
do you feel is your next season and also I don't know if this parlays but the
training talking to your trainer and your your training as much as how I see Jake train for his fights why are you
preparing for a legitimate fight are you wanting to go back into that or do you feel like the world fight's already big enough and you don't need to go back
into the cage for that yeah a lot of it depends on what happens with this Matrix attack in regards to fights but I'm always ready
and I've always stayed ready so I could fight tomorrow I'm I'm that ready but um
I enjoy it and I enjoy feeling ready even though the process is suffering I enjoy to feel ready at all times hence why I'm always training in regards to
Andrew Challenges George On Christianities Limitations For Being With Multiple Women
what the next stage is well I have personal goals as well outside of my internet goals and my
career goals and this is actually something very interesting I want to tie back into our earlier conversation when
we were talking about monogamy and poly poly polyamory and all these other things because it's my goal to have as
many children as possible is it so you could have your offsprings deliver your message or because you just want
kids like manyi disciples running around and being like if you have if you you have an Empire you need heirs right y if
you have a large empire you need a lot of airs right M so I want at least 25 children so what do you think oh you're
trying to mean Nick Canon out here yeah so what do you think from a religious perspective about someone who is destined on having as many children as
possible but obviously to do that he would need more than one woman do you still think that's a sin o um well I think putting your needs
above Gods is a sin so you need 25 kids it's interesting
is it my needs is it selfishness well you just said you were like well God is it you knew that it was to be against
God because God just wants you to have one woman perfect to be honest with you I've never read the Bible cover to cover so I don't know if it is spoiler alert
one man one woman yeah yeah sounds like a boring book but you know why he does that it's
it's it's to preserve Society no it's just to to demonstrate your relationship with him because once you stop you love
okay think about this right you love a woman Y and you provide a family yep a covenant yep a
kingdom but then you get to the point you're like I need more this is what Adam did with God I
need more don't you feel like let me answer ask the question from another way
don't you think the good people and the intelligent people of Earth need to be having kids at least at the same rate as the idiots I mean we have a population
no no it's a great question we have and this and we can also look at this we can take it away from the religious argument look at it another way we have a serious
population crisis in the west if you want I don't know if you know about this but there's a huge demographic collapse incoming and the reason we have these
Mass numbers of immigration is and the reason our cultures are collapsing is because we no longer reproduce at the at
the basic rate of s staining population so two people are supposed to have 3.7
kids on average for the population to increase but how many people do you know with four children very rare none so two
people have one kid population goes down two people have two kids population still goes down because people die people die in car crashes these kind of
things so we have huge problems from a socioeconomic point of view because you now have people living longer because of medicine they have longer pensions
longer retirements they need to be paid for you're supposed to have a huge tax space of young people working we don't
have anyone having enough children to sustain the tax base so what the people in charge of the world are doing is saying okay well then we need to import
third worlders to sustain this entire pyramid scheme we have this Ponzi scheme of you working your ass off so you can
retire later we need have to import third world wars who are going to work for pennies and they'll pay taxes so we can sustain it but that's why all the
cultures are collapsing so you look at this very interesting a Christian country is now being invaded by Muslims
and third worlders and you're losing your Christian identity because you don't have enough children to sustain the population yeah because you're only
allowed one woman got it so this is a interesting point where whereas a Muslim
man can have four wives and 16 kids just pump them out and they can survive and protect their identity and their culture
and their religion so it's actually very interesting and before I let you answer only one country solved this Hungary
Hungary is a Christian Nation and Victor Orban is one of the smartest world leaders on the planet he abolished
income tax for any family that has more than four children and he's fixed the population risis and the population is
increasing because people are getting married and having kids hungary's fixed it no other nation has fixed it because you can't even afford to have four or
five children because they're decimating you and destroying the currency and they're just doing all this Matrix propaganda on purpose anyway so besides
Hungary every other Western nation is now importing the Islamic world to sustain itself because Christian nations
can't reproduce so it's interesting what you said I agree with what you said but it's also the the death throws of
Christianity Christianity is about to be decimated because of that because what do you have without people you have my answer yeah okay
first would you like more coffee yeah I'll have two more coffees please can we get two more coffees thank you you want
some more coffee sure read sure please give my men coffee okay my answer is
this never in the day of age did we ever have the power to talk to a mass group of people since the internet y so
ironically we're running into this problem of less of our people but we
also have the gift of reaching out to more people correct so another household could have five kids but who's to say
that I can't encourage them to have my morals and standpoints absolutely you you couldn't you could you could I don't
need I don't need to procreate I need to provide and educate that's very interesting point of view but then you
Islam vs. Christianity
also this brings us into the Islam versus Christianity argument and I want to make it very clear to the world that
I am not anti-christian in any way most of my family is Christian my brother is Christian for a long time when I first
Tristan is Christian yeah he's Christian cool he's he's happy and he has fun yeah that's right perhaps perhaps that's
why when I first stopped being atheistic I reverted or diverted to Christianity
because it was all I knew because I was raised Christian I went to church as a kid it's all I knew but you're talking
about the fact that yeah people can come into the nation but if they become Christians once they arrive then the Christian Christian faith survives yeah
but I think that for that to happen there would have to be some form of power gap or power vacuum and it's not
atheists which are arriving and it's going to be very difficult to convince them out of Islam into Christianity and I I'll tell you
why I am not an Islamic scholar and I don't consider myself knowledgeable on
Islam I'm new to the religion I'm only a year in and I'm studying as best I can but there's a lot of people who know
more than me but from my understanding and my practi is Islam is very rigid and it's strict and you know what's right
and you know what's wrong and it provides Solutions and answers in a very strict non-ambiguous way and I feel like
if you live a difficult life like we talked about earlier about why my fan basee is so galvanized and why they
believe in me because I offer rigid solutions to problems and if you come from a difficult place or you Graz in a
difficult country or a war zone you're going to look for that R rigidity I don't think the softness of Christianity
and I don't say that as an insult I just state that as a matter of fact will be appealing to people who have come from
war zones I I just don't I think it's going to be very difficult to convert them to Christianity and and we're
seeing now in the Western World huge proportion of Christian countries are now just becoming Islamic strongholds
and and they can't be penetrated or or changed okay so but you're making it
seem like a lot of people that uh that worship Islam they're very very strict
with their policies there's a l there's a lot that I and by the way let me speak
positively about Islam so people don't confuse my my nature we're friends here by the way everyone we're on the same
yeah I I age don't speak for me I'm kid no no no uh uh no I actually I I really really
really really really respect Islam for one reason the way they stand up for their God absolutely and I actually take
notes from them so I don't want anybody in fact my God is their Prophet yep so we do we do see a lot of eye to eye we
just don't see the the final destination of who God is correct um but I definitely respect anybody in their in
their faith and I think it's I'd rather you have faith in a God then you have no faith in God at all AG so we're on the
same planfield okay um but to say that Christians have values
and they don't follow them and Islam does it's not true I I have many friends for example you're Islamic now but you
drink and you smoke no I don't drink oh not anymore but there's a lot that I have friends with that do so the theory
of them not following their rules is that's just a man I don't think that's a religion I think every man falls short I
think I think this is the truth I think an Islamic man that stands in front of me sins against God and I think a
Christian man sins against God oh yeah we're not perfect in any regard but
let's tie back to something I said earlier we're not perfect in any regard and it's all down to how you once again measure the success of a religion we
talked earlier about measuring the success of a business and life About Money numbers right numb but why is numbers account when it comes to Faith I
think it should be your well that's that's it it should be your faith but faith is very intangible and hard to
measure so I I'm just use be using my limited human brain let's just try and
measure the success of a religion the fastest growing religion is Islam it's not the biggest it's the fastest growing
yeah I think if you were to look at the insanity of the West I think
Islam opposes it hardest in regards to the the pure Insanity that is being
inflicted upon and bestowed upon children in the west I think Islam I want to say something a compliment for them what I I do appreciate is that they
they they don't let you cross bounds right so for example when they were making a mockery of my Lord and Savior
yeah I didn't see Christians trying to tear down these movies I see Christians trying to hey that's not okay blah BL
blah right Islamic people were like you're not talking about a prophet like that so I I find that very beautiful and
I understand that they hold their values but let me ask you a question do you not find that appealing very do you not find
it appealing to be part of a religion where you get to stand up for what you really believe in and say no you can't
say that no you won't do that no not to us yeah I think they have beautiful qualities that I should learn from but
that doesn't mean I have to worship their God I mean people often ask why reverted to Islam and I I I heard
someone say something that you see life and you see other people as you see yourself so if you're a thief you think
everyone's a thief you're worried about everyone stealing from you because you would steal in their position that's how you like view the world that's how
cheaters view that's how cheaters view the world that's right and then I was sitting thinking well maybe and of
course this just came from my mind I said well maybe you see a religion how you see yourself like I see myself as
somebody who is feared nobody would want to mock I see myself as somebody with strict standards and discipline I see
myself as somebody who stands up for what he believes in and doesn't care if he's assaulted and attacked for it maybe
that's why it was so appealing to me I and then I I'd sit and I'd study it and I'd read and I'd realize how close it
actually is to Christianity we believe in so many of the same things and I don't want to get in trouble here
because I am not an Islamic scholar in any way but I've had even other people say to me some Christians who I spoke to who started to read the Quran they're
like it's just condensed it's like Stronger Yeah and and and I think that's what the appeal of it is to me and I I
also like having hard yeses and Nos and I I believe that if you have a religion where you just accept everything yeah
then you believe in nothing there has to be a line in life there has to be a line that you won't let someone cross and
with God there should be the same and my only concern with Christianity and I I argue this with my brother at length is
if God will really truly forgive anything then then then if he'll truly
forgive you doing the most pest acts you can possibly think of and you repeatedly do them and you won't learn your lesson
and you'll do them over and over again and even Christians themselves won't ostracize you is that too far is that
too much Freedom like you asked earlier I love this so this is beautiful it's actually in my notes I was going to circle this with it um Let me let me
just give me a second to make sure I word this properly absolutely for let's Circle to forgiveness
yeah how many times should you forgive a man well that's a really good question cuz we are sinners and we make endless
mistakes and the prophet that you see as Jesus do you know what he talks about forgiveness as tell me he Peter asks him
how many times should you forgive a man and he says stimes 77 and then he also describes the way Judgment Day comes and
he goes you will be measured by the measurement that you gave others so the way you looked at your brothers and
sisters that man wronged you but you said you're dead to me you're you're debt I don't even want it
yeah that's how you'll be measured but here let me Circle back repentance isn't doing the same sin over
and over and enjoying it and asking for forgiveness that's why God doesn't judge
your actions like I said he judges the reflection of your heart yeah so if I
sinned against you there's two types of men Andrew dude listen I'm a police Andrew I messed up dude like I'm so
sorry that I did this D I didn't mean it this is what happened and you could see the stress in his eyes from him hurting
you hey Dad that I know you told me not to do this and I was I was with my friends and or hey Andrew my bad bro
yeah it won't happen again this [ __ ] guy yeah yeah there's a difference of course you can't hide your heart from
God absolutely so I that's why I say only God could judge and and I remember what I was going to say about uh your
God and my God right I believe that if there is a God out there he wants you to
come in the same direction that I'm going vice versa so I think I never want to uh debate religion ever because then
I'm trying to disprove your God and that might be holding your heart and I don't want to do that I age but what we could
do is I say I'll pray to my God and you pray to your God to open up one of our eyes and hearts and whoever is wrong or
whoever is Right will guide us with wisdom to the right direction I love that and you know what I kind of feel like when I'm talking to people of other
religious faiths and I like I said I have to be very careful I'm not an Islamic scholar and like you said I
don't want to ever insult Christians or insult other religious faiths the only people I have I like to argue with
correctly and properly are atheists because they need to learn the light yeah I'll join I'm
kidding I feel like if if there's one god let's imagine there's one sentence and it's the most beautiful sentence
that you can possibly think of that can be constructed with the most compend and gorgeous language that can be put
together I feel like the different religions are perhap perhaps different languages to say the same thing Y and
you know German sounds different to Russian sounds different to English but you can say it in different ways but it all means the same thing and I feel like
that's the best way to look at it and to a degree the Quran also says the same thing it says that we're a lot closer than we are apart and I think when I
meet somebody of another faith I still feel happy for them and I feel glad for
them it's only when I meet somebody who sits down and thinks they're a smart ass oh no we came from monkeys I'm like oh bro you need help those are the people I
argue with uh those people are more lost than ever and here's the thing man like a lot of people will ask me like how do
you forgive CU forgiveness is such a sometimes it gets so hard especially when you know that that person wrongs you purposefully y
um and my theory goes back to this forget the way I measures the way he's going to measure me
y but my God came and paid a penalty for me y because I couldn't pay that
penalty how can I look at another man knowing that every time I come on my knees and I say God like provide me
shelter provide me safety provide me this and he always comes through for me and then I Wrong him him I walk and by
the way this is the worst part I walk into sin willingly man you think that I feel good having sex with my girlfriend
I do that's besides the point I felt I I had to say I do because I do have I do I felt like I was going to lie she's
watching I do have I have great time having sex but afterwards it like it haunts me because we're not married okay
that was a bad example let me take that out because that was a that's I'm walk but you know what no that's true cuz I walk into that right I walk into sin
that was my choice I walked into it but God knows my heart he knows what I'm dealing with he knows my steps he hovers
me because I ask him to go before me so he's making the path for me now people
when they see me talk about God they make it seem like I'm so holier than thou and I don't make mistakes no the beautiful part is I am an endless bucket
of mistakes we all are but how gracious is God to be like I get it man yeah and
I think the way we get out of sin and the blessings that are given to us like you were blessed but do you know why you
were blessed because you were given the privilege of wisdom yeah there's another
top G somewhere else same body same brain same everything but he didn't have
that wisdom and wisdom was given to you Proverbs in the Bible was a king and he
How God Gives Wisdom
could have asked anything from God and he goes I just want wisdom how does God give wisdom to you how does he give
wisdom to me first you got to seek and you shall find knock and the door shall be open right so it's like what are you
asking for for example when I asked God to be in this meeting I don't go hey God
please make sure I have a great great podcast and I kill it and I get views no I go God hey let me stir up a
conversation that wakes up somebody's heart but for me to do that I need to be prepared so prepare me to be a man that
could talk against a man who's very diligent with his tongue I wasn't prepared for this God made me prepared
for this abut so when I ask God for things I don't get lazy with my prayers I don't go hey God make me a rich famous
man now how do you get there if God was sitting at this table and we're going to try to to conquer this world in a
healthy way how are we going to do it we got to ask for steps first I need a good team I need good Hearts I need the right
tools people are asking God as if he's a make a wish Genie like just like hey I
want a a baddy with a fatty it's like bro what do you what do you go on like what you some of the prayers that people
ask that God doesn't even deliver it's better for them not to have it he knows best he knows best but I also feel like
God gives wisdom God gives wisdom through tribulation and suffering I'm smarter because of
jail he wanted to teach me something but question did you not ask for this life first oh absolutely so what came first
was it the fact that you thirsted for a higher life or was it that God threw you into that because for me if you asked me
to be a trainer hey I need you to train me I'm going to put you through your test oh absolutely so you asked God for
that he didn't just put you in that circumstance and and that's one of the things that's very interesting you have people who will sit at home and pray for
an exceptional life they'll say I don't want to live a normal life I want an exceptional life I want a special life a
different life and then they'll do exceptional things they'll fly on a private jet they'll buy a Bugatti they'll sit in a $10 million mansion
somewhere on the coast and then cry if they end up in jail exceptional doesn't always mean good exceptional means
deviate from the norm you begged God for exceptional a Romanian jail cell is a unique experience just as a Bugatti on a
private jet is a unique experience if you want the experiences there's no light without dark you can't have both if you're going to pray to God and ask
for all these amazing things you have to understand there's an equal and opposite force and you will pay the price and who here there's a beautiful thing let me
backtrack that one line you just said you could pray for something but remember there's two people on the phone listening to your
prayers yeah I like that and here's the craziest part you know when who's giving it to
you yep you know deep in your heart you can feel it of course you can feel it you're lying to me if you say you can't
feel and you know what maybe that's where I'm self-reflecting we're talking about being vulnerable I'll be vulnerable maybe that's actually where a
lot of my motivation comes from despite the fact I think I'm genuinely putting my life and my livelihood in danger by
speaking so much truth against the Matrix is if I was getting all of this money and all of this Fame and I wasn't
talking about God and doing good for the world I'd be very sure the devil was giving it to me I'd feel it I'd feel
cheap I'd feel dirty and I would feel anxious like okay I've got this Fame
what am I doing for the world okay I may be entertaining I may get some views I may get some clicks but what am I giving
the people who believe in me am I scamming them am I Hur in them are they getting better what am I doing for the
people who know my name am I just taking all this [ __ ] from the devil and I'm not giving anything back am I actually
making anyone feel better about themselves and then you sit there and realize that yeah you are you're taking it from the devil you'll pay the price
tenfold with your soul this is why I sit this is why I sit and find The Bravery to think I'm currently on bail in the
middle of a judicial process inside of the country we are sitting in right now I've been advised by all legal counsil
to not do podcasts here I am doing a podcast why because I know people will listen to it and I can give a good
message out there and I believe that I can D drive people in a holy Direction regardless of which religion whether
they choose Christianity or Islam I believe there will be people who watch this and decide to believe in God that's
worth it to me and then the money I'm achieving 10 years from now whatever I know it came from me trying to do the
right thing I didn't scam people on crypto I didn't sell [ __ ] to kids I didn't do none of that stuff that that
is from the devil and you will pay the price for that you can't there's no light without dark you can't just go through life robbing banks and think
Andrew's Platform Was Given To Him By God & His Responsibility
you're going to get away with it I I got a I got a parable for you that's in the Bible and I think this kind of relates to you a little bit but before I say
that can I and and be honest with me do you feel like in your heart that if you did not do that for God or if you did
not do it you feel like it's going to be taken away from you yes there's a parable in the Bible
and I'm going to rephrase it so I want people to go read it because I'm going to most likely not do it justice but I'm
going to speak in a way that people could understand we'll say a king comes up to three servants he goes I'm going
to give you four pieces of gold or no no no crops we'll say crops right four crops
for you two crops for you one crop for you go plant your Fields the one with
four goes awesome look what God gave me boom boom boom and he made it like so
much the second one who had two he goes wow he gave me two boom boom boom boom boom and I did it okay the one who has
one goes oh man I don't want to mess up with the one thing that he gave me give the other guy like four three and then
I'm going to mess this up okay you know what I'm going to do I'm going to hide it I'm going to hide it and then when God comes back I'm like hey man I didn't lose it look I have it right here you
know what God did he cursed them he said give it to me and he gave it to the one who could multiply it because at the end
he thought that all of the glory was because of him but he should have known that if it did well it was going to be
for God so there was no failing you have to go out and know that everything was given to you and it's a privilege to be
in the chair that you're in absolutely have that voice that you have that can tune into so many of these kids ears
there's a responsibility that you're holding I truly think the next Journey that you're going to have is a spiritual
one yeah I think it is oh and you're completely right and and when you asked me the question that I said yes to the
reason I said yes is if God gave me this platform and then I acted a coward and I
was afraid to talk because of the Matrix or because they came for me or because I'll lose my money or because they'll lock me up I would pay for that
cowardice he would give it to the one who's not a coward he' give it to the man who's not a coward which might be the reason that gave it to me in the first place because I was the one who
was standing up fighting against all this [ __ ] earlier on it's the one who did it I was the one who went nuts and I think that's why you were boasted in
Pride because at the moment he's like I'm not going to remove that from him just yet because that's what's fueling him regardless I need him to do that job
Apostle Paul he killed people he was killing Christians he just destroys this
Christian that was a disciple in front of him and that Christian was like this is so predictable look at you guys he
goes you guys have done this on and on and on and then God took Paul and made him one of the greatest disciples this
is an ongoing thing that people don't understand it's usually the people that God the humans would be like God would
never use that guy and there's like oh use that guy when Jesus was born the first thing they asked is from where
that's their first question from the ghetto what good comes from that place why are they why the kings of Kings is
coming from there don't believe it are Kings coming in on a donkey I don't believe it yeah I
think I know you don't talk to people I know that after you're done with a podcast
you kind of go on and do what you need to do but I would love to stay in contact because I feel like we could sharpen each other I think so too I
think it would be very interesting certainly I think uh to be honest I I would love to extend the conversation
but sometimes when I feel like it's it's ready to go it's ready to go we have part two ready already lined up so it'll
happen some point some point in the future thank you so much for being here man I really and truly cuz like this
this is uh putting my show in different map and I think you know that too and I really appreciate your time thank thanks for coming
friend they never believe me I would never drop the ball I know I make it look easy




I would believe I'm a stronger version of myself post jail and if you put me back I'll emerge stronger than ever before in this episode you see the most
Unleashed and exposed Andrew Tate send me to jail right now I'll go Life Is War
every single aspect of life is war for more than a year Andrew Tate has told me personally he wants to share what's
really gone on but he's been silenced because of his imprisonment and because of his lawyers this whole Matrix attack
the point of it was to digitally assassinate me and destroy my influence they're coming for all of us they're not just coming for me with all of us
they're coming for any single person who has a degree of sovereignty about their mindset this is the first podcast Andrew
T has done in a long time and he gave me this exclusive this content is so wild we had to break it down into two parts 5
hours of me interrogating Andrew Tate there are people in a room right now as we speak trying to put bej before I tell
you the wild discussions we had I'm giving away £30,000 worth of exclusive
prizes just for listening to both parts of this Andrew Tate la launch all you have to do is find the secret question
hidden in these two episodes Andrew do you think you'll
still be assassinated that's a very good question so I have to decide how I'm
going to answer this because every time I'm asked a question as a consument professional I think about five different
answers firstly the first answer I gave is that they've already attempted to assassinate me digitally at least and my
character that's clear this whole Matrix attack the point of it was to digitally assassinate me and destroy my influence
if they accused me of tax evasion or money laundering nobody would care so
they accused you of a sex crime it's not just me Russell bran they got Tucker
Carlson they're after it's the standardized Playbook by The Matrix because they want to prove to the world you're a very bad person and there's
always people out there who are so stupid that they're going to sit and go ah the 85th time this has happened he's
a bad person and they're going to believe it what's very interesting about it is not only do they believe it they also conveniently forget about all the
actual sex criminals which work inside of the mainstream media and work for the establishment because they're only mentioned for a day and then they're put
away whereas people like me they'll mention that I am a human trafficker every single day for a year and a half
they have not stopped when Hugh Edwards sends picture of his ass somewhere that's gone in 24 hours or
scoffield the first question they asked him how do you feel are you okay bro if
you work for the establishment they protect you if you work against them they they attempt to digitally assassinate you so they've already
attempted to assassinate me and my character that's the first thing the second way I'll answer that question is
there was a time I was Public Enemy Number One and I now feel like I'm Public Enemy
Number Seven and I think that's because of the election coming up I'm actually not that
overtly political I think it's pretty clear what my politics are and my overall stance on how the world should
be viewed and masculinity as a whole is something they fear but I'm not directly
political and I feel like because it's an election cycle and election year there's certain other people they might want to put a bullet in first and you
know the age old adage you don't have to be the fastest person running from the bear you just have to be faster than the
slowest one so I feel like perhaps they won't assassinate me this year are they
trying to put me in jail for sure which I guess is another form of assassination I mean what's the M what's
the point being alive if you're to sell cockroaches and that's done through liberal liberally funded Nos and the
media machine so for me to answer the question as a whole they've already
attempted to assassinate me my character they're still attempting to assassinate me put me in jail will they put a bullet
in me maybe next year but for this year I should be able to drive my Ferrari so I bought a couple new ones and we'll be
okay yeah because when I first met you we did the first episode you talked through the three stages y um counseling
yeah in the media imprisonment and that was about 3 weeks before you went to
prison that's right I'm on my last life yeah yeah does that you're smiling does
that not scare the sh out of you it does because it's you know you're on a video game and you're on your last life and you really have to pull it off and I
guess it is scary but then you have to sit and realize that if
you're am I afraid the reason I'm not afraid is because I don't see any other choice I
don't see the point in being afraid because I don't see any other option if you refuse to fight in a war you don't
eliminate Wars you only eliminate yourself if you have an opponent who is set on attempting to destroy you and you
say well I don't want to fight that doesn't make the the war go away that just makes you go away and they're
coming for all of us they're not just coming for me I'm just in all of us they're coming for any single person who
has a degree of sovereignty about their mindset they're coming up for anyone who refuses to believe the slave programming
for anyone who wants to have a happy family and a good life for anyone with any degree of masculine imperative for
anyone who has a degree of individualism they're coming for all of us and they're trying to make us all slaves and I have a massive influence yes so I'm a primary
target but they're not just coming for me they're coming for absolutely everybody else and I don't see why it would be prudent for me to sit and say
oh well they might kill me if I continue to talk so I'll just shut up and then maybe they'll kill me later along with
everybody else I think I'll feel happier in myself knowing that no I went down guns blazing and I think it's pretty
obvious now to anyone with a brain what their agenda is their agenda is mass surveillance firstly because that's how
they make money nowadays via surveillance capitalism and surveillance have gone hand inand that's the first
thing and second by extension is mass slavery and I I know that's coming so am
I afraid it's kind of like are you afraid of being struck by
lightning if you go outside what can you do about it you know I guess my option is I could take
all my money disappear and shut up but the war is certain and it's coming for us all anyway and I've said this on other podcast but it's it's true you
either fight against this garbage they're trying to inject into everybody's minds and you're at war
against them or you believe all the garbage they tell you and you're at war against yourself if you believe the crap
they want you to believe you're depressed unhappy sad bu lonely so what's the choices you're
you're going to fight something I'd rather fight my enemies than fight myself so yeah I'm on my last life and I
would never kill myself and I smile every day it is what it is and do you say I would never kill myself just for
the record in case like other famous people we hear of you hanging from a bed
well yeah I mean when I was in jail there was I think there was three or four suicides in the first couple weeks
and were they suicides I believe so but it was making me very nervous I was like are they setting up a pattern here of
suicide I'm like suicide yeah it's scary that is scary yeah it is scary so I have
to make it very clear and I also think another reason I'm so happy despite the fact I feel
like I'm a public enemy is because being happy angers these people my only weapon against all of these people and all this
garbage is to smile there are people sitting in a dark room right now there are people in a room right now as we
speak full grown adults professionals trying to put me in jail there are teams there's a prosecutor and his underlings
sitting there analyzing my entire life every message I've ever sent everywhere I've ever been and what I've ever spoken
to ever as we speak trying to put me back in a dungeon at the same time there
are people sitting around trying to cancel me get me off the internet make sure I have no influence no work they're sitting there they've Frozen all my bank
accounts have taken almost 20% of my car collection almost they've put me in jail that and
they've done all this to me and they're sitting there trying to attack me and I smile that's my
weapon that's my weapon they me to [ __ ] in jail I don't care and and that
resilience is how I fight against them because I believe this is a spiritual war more than anything else the reason
they're trying to attack me is because I'm seen as a hero to so many young boys and that inspires bravery in the young
boys so they're trying to kill the hero so I can't allow them to make me sad or miserable or depressed I refuse I refuse
I will smile in my jail cell I refute and refuse to be afraid or scared or
depressed happiness wins love wins I'm happy shoot me I'll smile if they would
come up put a gun in my face and say time's up I'd say I knew you were GNA
back that's the weapon what else am I supposed to do are you still having nightmares my nightmares are gone and
you know what I'm not going to I'm going to be very open about this I'm genuinely sad about that sad about what my night
is leaving me BR it because it was a new level to the game of life I guess
new experience it was interesting it was kind of fun you know like before I go to
sleep in jail I had that there's my my room I'm glad I went to jail in the winter I guess it'd be lot worse in the
summer but there was a really bad infestation of cockroaches and they were always in in the blankets and uh when
you slept you got warm so they'd all like all the insects and bed everything would try and attract to you so you'd
wrap up and put your trousers in your socks I had like a pillowcase I put over my head to stop them getting in my mouth
and like there's insects everywhere yeah on everything they're all over the the
ceiling and uh for a while before I go to bed at home I'm kind of like looking in my covers for insects and stuff and I
catch myself doing it going this is this is unique you know before I go to bed I have to I check all my stuff and then I
get in bed and I'm not relaxed and I think might be something crawling on me and then I go to sleep and I wake up and
a pan but the whole thing to me was almost very I was almost observing it in the third person was almost like oh cool
this is something I've never done before and I got a lot of training done I mean well because you couldn't sleep because
I couldn't sleep yeah I was like all right let me just go bench press another 20,000 kilo yeah uh because I'm not one
to waste time I mean I certainly got a lot of my life in order and I think the
reason I miss it now is because I sleep five or six hours at night now but back then three two three hours max I got
tons done I made a bunch of money my training was on schedule were you able to have your phone in there then and do work no no this is my it's funny cuz I
didn't have nightmares in jail right in jail I slept as weird as it is I had nightmares when I left jail right and
thought I might go back any minute and I still might go back any minute but now I'm like oh whatever but when I for the
first three or four months when I was out of jail when I was having very bad nightmares at home I was remark markably
efficient I kind of missed yeah I got load I got loads done um so I kind of
missed them and I missed that whole it was a it was a different way to
live it was a different level to the game and I think a lot of people would be like oh no I'm having nightmares I have to make them go away why nightmares
aren't real why would I have to make them go away is a genuine question
because I'm sure a therapist or some other matrix-m minded idiot would tell me how important is they're gone but I didn't understand why a nightmare can't
hurt me okay I woke up boohoo I woke up boo let's all cry our eyes out I woke up
no just go train I think the I my nightmares didn't bother me that much I'm kind of sad they're gone the women
who would sleep next to me it pissed them off or I was like you never sleep I was like yeah I
can't they' just be lazy sleeping 12 hours and I'd be up doing this doing this so I kind of miss my nightmares
unfortunately they're gone but perhaps God will give me another experience which brings them back to me and then I will enjoy them once again are you hard
on yourself like I'm not I don't pick up much sympathy about anything from you I don't
know you reading well so maybe a judgment from where I'm seeing but are you hard on yourself and do you
sometimes lack sympathy or self-love am I hard on myself yes does
that benefit me I believe so I'm hard on myself because life is hard I think the
it could be life be easier if you thought life was easy because isn't life what you know what it is what's the point in having an easy life why would I
want an easy life if someone were to say to me do you want an easy life I'd say that sounds Bor I mean did genas Khan want an
easy life did Alexander the Great want an easy life did any of the men you can remember from history any of the ones
that actually matter ever want an easy life if I meet a man and he says I want an easy life I just want a stressfree
life I look at him and think you're born to lose you're born to lose sir you can have your stress-free life and you can
serve me my latte and you go fck off because you're you're not made to it life is war and it's going to be
stressful and life isn't always war of course it is life is war every single aspect of life is war not losing your
temper in traffic on your way to a podcast is war trying to get a girl that the other guy wants is war trying to buy
a Ferrari that everybody else can't afford is war training is war fighting is war Life Is War I I see War
everywhere when I see a big beautiful oak tree I don't see a big beautiful oak tree I see a tree destroyed all the
saplings around it and crushed them mercilessly it's War Life Is War so
that's how I view it I guess the only disadvantage of being so hard on myself because I don't see any disadvantages
because I have zero self- sympathy I blame myself for absolutely everything even this Matrix attack I want to make
it very clear I'm not looking for sympathy on any level I'm not an idiot I ran my mouth on the internet for a very
long time I pissed off very important powerful people and they and they put me in a jail cell I sat there in jail like
well I'm here for the wrong reasons but all in all the fair enough the universe is giv
me I you know you run your mouth and you piss people off they're going to try and teach you a lesson that's how the world
works like I'm not going to sit there and feel sorry for myself I guess the only disadvantage of being so hard on myself is that I'm extremely hard on
others and some people find me difficult to deal with for that reason they'll be like Oh I'm struggling with this I'm
like I do not give it has to be done at this time oh
yeah but but but I don't care you will lose your job if it's not done at this time that's the bottom line and I guess
I can be ruthless but why would I have sympathy for somebody else I don't have for myself if I'm going to be so strict on myself why would I why would I allow
sympathy for others if I know I'm going to do it I'm going to hold them to my standard no so I guess to a degree I can
be I can come across as unempathetic to others I guess but um at least I'm not
hypocrite you know and I also like to believe that that because I lead from the front I'm not a
armchair General I'm suffering myself so if I'm going to suffer and I'm going to
perform and I'm going to get everything I need to do done that I expect absolutely the same from everybody around me or they're not going to be
around me anymore so am I hard on myself yes will that change no life is war life
is hard you're supposed to be hard on yourself perhaps most men would benefit from being a lot harder on themselves I
think I see a lot of men coming up with a lot of excuses for permanent failure I see it all the time why I can't pay my
bills that up okay cool why oh you know cuz it's hard it's all just sympathy bull I don't I don't want to hear it
it's garbage it's hard it's hard for everybody and you're gonna have to just be harder on yourself and pull it off or fail and don't talk to
me I I bro it's it's I don't know what to say I don't want to come across the psychopath but it's like life is
difficult and also I mean we all we all know that everyone there's always someone who has it worse but that's that's true I mean
we're in Romania you can drive 5 hours to the border and you'll find men in a ditch getting blown apart by drones
you're crying over what a b left you a girl left you some chick who doesn't love you anymore and you're well you're
not going to do your work because of it well then you're just born to lose why do you call women and hoes I don't call
them hoes I say a left you and I say it
because if a man's talking about his woman leaving him I guess it's a
detrimental way because he's obviously mad at her I don't yeah I don't I'm
actually going to make this clear I no longer prescribe to the asinine the parameters of of these
attack words they use these words like misogynistic and homophobic and racist
all these words are just attack the weapons they're weapons and they're weaponized so that you don't have an
opinion on certain subjects I have opinions on female males and I have opinions on males I have opinions on
cats and dogs and the rain and the sunshine I have opinions on certain
things and some of them are generalized I believe in general men should go and die in a war do I hate men because I
think they should be blown apart I also believe women can't park cars very well shoot me put me in jail put me back with
the Cockroaches oh no he said it these are my observations I've come through through my life the number of times I've
seen a woman struggling to parallel Park I can't even imagine I can't even and someone can come to me and say oh but the insurance statistics that don't care
about Matrix statistics uninterested I have seen with my own eyes their failures at parallel parking that's my
belief am I a misogynist no do I hate them no it's just an observation I have
and this whole word is weaponized anyway so I no longer prescribe to these parameters it's all ASD entities which I
no longer prescribe to I have opinions on everything and everyone we say that oh I call
you say why do you call women I just call men kids I I just said you're a loser I just called men losers nobody
cares nobody cares what I call men losers or brokies but if I say some woman who breaks a man's heart oh she's evil oh
then I'm a misogynist they are a protected class and I don't think it should be that way I think that if we're
going to live in a society where women are equal to men which is fine and they're going to be held then they
should be held to the same standard as men are huge news years in the making my brand new book that my Publishers refuse
to publish money Matrix beat the money system and build generational wealth
understand the three main ways that the banks productize you and make money from you you'll be able to turn that system
against itself build generational wealth and multiple streams of recurring income it's all at moneyat docash and if you're
quick the first few hundred registrants and buyers will receive many special bonuses from me the brand new money
maker Summit 3-day special event meet me at a champagne pain reception meet me at a multi-millionaire networking dinner go
now money matrix. this is huge do you think women are equal to men in certain respects
women are superior to men but I think we're very different there are certain areas in which a woman will outperform a
man and there are certain areas in which a man will outperform a woman that makes me a misogynist by modern standards
because you can't mention the areas in which a man will outperform a woman but women are definitely better than men at a lot of things right would you drop
your child off at an all male day care I have a three-year-old daughter would you leave her with 20 men all day
no question dead by the afternoon well well then well then you believe in gender roles why do you believe in
gender roles we I believe women are better better at certain things and men are better at certain things naturally
biologically absolutely evolutionarily completely so so there you go so now you believe in gender roles which is the
number one thing they hate the most so when I say there's gender roles in a man should lead because a man is calmer Under Pressure then they have a mental
breakdown but but we have roles in which we perform our best right and I think and I
think that everybody with a functioning brain doesn't get offended by that obvious reality knows it's true there
are certain scenarios where a man will perform better than a woman and certain scenarios where a woman will perform better than a man and we exist best as a
species when the woman does what she's best at and the man does what he's best at if you have a tailor and an
accountant and they want to open a company together well that company will be most successful if the tailor makes
the clo and the accountant does the accounting it's not going to do very well if you try and mix it up or they start arguing
with each other saying I can be an accountant just as well as you can and the account is like well I can make her sure now what you have a mess and then
they fail and that's what's happening right now in Western Society why can our countries no longer compete by basically
any metric well because everything's a mess Attis you go deep around the rabbit hole you ask yourself are they trying to
make this mess on purpose and then you work out they are then you work out who they are and all these liberally funded
Nos and why they're doing it how they're trying to make us all Slaves by destroying masculinity the first thing you have to do if you want to enslave a
populace is destroy the people who defend the population which are always going to be the men because the men fight days of old they' come in and just
kill all the military age males now they just nouer us then you have me when you say ne to us you mean remove our
masculinity absolutely yeah they neuter us we're now live we're now living in a world where a man is Remar is remotely
masculine in any way he's attacked for it if I say my wife isn't to talk to other
men mental breakdowns they're about to put me on bbc1 this morning all over the
front of the Guardian whoever watches this crap Andrew T is toxically masculine he's controlling he's evil in
his heart why because my woman is not allowed to go Parky with a bunch of dudes one she doesn't want to that's the
first thing she doesn't want to secondly if I had a wife and she said I want to go party with Mike and Nathan I who whoa
whoa who who's Mike and who is Nan no you're not and if she says well I'm
going to do it I'll say fine then you then I'm not your husband goodbye I'm not going to attack her I'm not going to
beat her up but I have standards once again they attack masculinity because masculinity is based on parameters and
standards that's what masculinity is masculinity has always been traditionally defending a border let's
go back a couple thousand years what did the men do this is our land if you come here you have to fight us
that's all masculinity ever was so we're masculinity in of itself is built around enforcing parameters and you enforce
parameters with your children in your business in your relationship and your in your friendships that's what you do
as a man but you're not allowed to now that's how they attack masculinity you know you have to accept everything
especially from women if you don't accept everything from women all of the time you're a misogynist if you have any
standards whatsoever you're a bad person you're not even allowed standards and how a woman
looks here let me get sent back to jail I don't find fat women
attractive if a woman says I don't find short men attractive who cares nobody if
I say fat women aren't attractive they're about to put me once again good morning fat shaming to misogynistic that
they're going to attack me for having a standard why am I not allowed a standard as a man they have standards in fact I'd argue women have higher standards than
anyone ask the average woman on the street what she wants in a man the
average woman I don't want them to be short I want him to be rich I want him to be smart I want him to be interesting charismatic he has to be spontaneous and
he has to love my family and he has to love my dog and then it should go on for 25 minutes about what she wants all I'm
saying is put the donuts down and they want to throw me back in jail all I'm saying is don't eat so much
pie whole thing is hypocritical and it's garbage and that's why this whole misogynistic attack is garbage and
they're doing it specifically so that men don't have any standards anymore and that's why they're trying to neuter us
because if you have standards especially in your household the number one thing that's going to inspire you to
resistance is sticking up for defending your family by extension your town by extension your nation if they attack it
at the nucleus uh if they attack it at the very beginning if you don't feel like a man in your own house if you have
no control and influence over your own castle why do you care about what happens to your town or you're or your
country and then they come along with this enslavement and you're just like oh well okay I guess and you just sit there
and just end up a slave waiting for the QR code to be stamped on your head for the camera to detect if you're allowed
to walk down that street or you get fing a bullet in your head from this the robot sniper it's where it's all going
so they don't like masculinity masculinity is no good to them masculinity was only good to them if we'd go and die in wars and now a lot of
men have woken up to that stupid we're not going to do that anymore and they've made enough they've got good enough
technology they can just send some planes or some cruise missiles and blow up whatever farmer needs to Die For Freedom some poor innocent farmer who
made $3 his entire life he needs to be blown apart by a $600,000 missile otherwise you won't be free to get a
coffee so they're going to go do that so what are they need masculinity for because we have parameters they don't
want us to have parameters they want us to accept everything and they start with this feminism garbage it's really
interesting because I would argue and I'm pretty good at
arguing I've been around I've been around has ever anyone
ever beaten you in an argument no never could anyone uh it depends what we're
arguing about but I I believe that I can argue even when I know I'm wrong who who could beat you an argu who could
challenge you to a great argument it's a good question it depends on the subject
I'm not that impressed by any of these intellectuals we see so Jordan Peterson
could he out argue you Peterson and I have an interesting relationship I I believe the enemy of my
enemy is my friend however I do believe it's hypocrite I think it's very difficult to
sit and talk about mental rigidity and how you should be a man who is unafraid
of the horrors of the world and then end up addicted to anti-depressants I think that's hypocritical personally he also talks very slowly
which is why he would always lose an argument to me because he's too slow and I'm very fast speed whns trust me I've
been in the cage I know so and he knows that so he would never want to debate me but I guess it depends what we're
talking about if he wants to talk about the intricacies of some old philosopher some book he's read I've never read the
book maybe he could perhaps pull off a semi-interesting point but then I also
believe I'm quickfire bro I'll tell that's no big deal but yeah what about
Elon Musk did you see him rinse own journalist BBC J he amazing that was
[ __ ] genius it was amazing and and and and it's amazing also how I like to
believe I've been a huge component or a very important point a very important part of the Matrix cracking because I do
think it's actually cracking now only the very stupid believe anything the MSM says anymore anyone with a brain has Wok
up and realized that everything is a lie everything is a lie education's a lie
Judicial Systems a lie the news is a lie money is a lie everything's a lie
everything you were taught in education was a lie all of it and anyone with a
brain is starting to realize that now the inter Dynamics between men and women against a lie we can go back to the
original Point talking about men and women and it's always the thing that gets me in trouble but it's true and when I was going to say I'll argue the
point I'll argue the point that 80% of women agree with me I've never had a
negative interaction with a female Ever every single woman who comes up me never never ever besides Lucy from the BBC
every single woman who comes up to me on the street says finally you're telling the truth you must have had an ex that
doesn't like you they all missed me they they scroll Instagram seeing my face
endlessly like ah how do I get him back no really though we've all been hurt
we've it's not about being hurt I'm talking about the fact they try and paint this image of me being disliked by
women and I've never experienced it at all I get thousands of love letters a week thousands from women all around the
world begging to be with me it's it's the truth and all I do is
say the absolute truth so once again we talk about lies not only are they lying trying to pretend I'm an enemy of females which I'm not they also lie
about how men and women into Dynamics should work they lie about that they sit and say no to keep your woman happy let her do whatever she wants and let her be
basically in charge let her run around and do whatever she likes let her have male friends and buy her all this stuff
and that's not true it doesn't work and it's a s off on many levels I was
talking to my brother yesterday where I was saying that I believe currently there's this Global
competition between women who have found themselves a s of who can cuck their man
the hardest on Tik toking words crack me up bro but it's true no but you see
these women they're like I found my perfect man and he bought me all the they run around with their phone he bought me all these Louis Vuitton BS he
bought me this car and I'm out now with my girlies for coffee with my allowance and he's going to give me a $3 million
wedding and I'm going to wear a white dress and that she's just advertising the subservience of her man she's just
saying my man's a slave he's a s because twice a month he might get lucky and I'm
G to advertise to all the other women on Tik Tok how well I've got my slave behaving I'm going to cuck him publicly
and it's like a big Global competition and I see these Tik toks of this insanity and I'm like I'm a billionaire
and my woman yeah she looked after of course but if she was running around making Tik toks like this I'd be like you better delete that account or get
aing job I think they're hiring over at McDonald's young lady you want to go you
want to go buy $10,000 bags and talk about that but and that's she's not doing that to show appreciation to her
man absolutely not she's doing it to show status to other women she's showing off and the worst thing about it is
people will have her convinced or the world will have you convinced that that woman's now happy with her man she isn't she doesn't respect him
which means she's miserable anyway which is why she's so obsessed with money and cars and garbage because she's miserable
if a woman really loves you she doesn't even care about that stuff so there's a global competition to cuck your man and
that's part of the the SOP inside of the Matrix because they're trying to destroy the idea of inter personal Dynamics
because that's where happy families come from which comes which inspires resistance a woman's happy when she has
a man she truly looks looks up to and truly respects she's not going to respect you if you're if you're a Bank
take it from a very rich man if you're nothing but a bank she ain't going to respect you if she respects you and gets
rewarded and gets presence and it's taken care of of course but if you are simply a bank account to her she's not going to respect you why do these rich
men's wives sleep with the gardener it's the gardener he broke as a
joke because they don't respect you so all of this is part of the larger s and
a lot of women come up to me and and and sing my Praises Maybe well 80% of the
fan mail I receive is from women what does that do to your ego like does it give you a God complex
do I have an ego of course you [ __ ] have an ego of course I do yeah who wouldn't to G you know what's actually
kind of cool the only thing that's kind of cool about it is if I if I want to go on a date let's say and I don't because
I've settled down now I've got my wives I've settled down found you know 11 good ones and I'm done I'm a loyal man but
let's say uh let's say I want to go on a date it's kind of cool because I remember days of
old where like you'd have to go on a date and you'd have to sit and like talk and be
interesting you know you'd have to be like oh so tell me again about your job what do you do oh marketing wow that
must be hard that's definitely not a diversity hire tell me more about uh what do you do three emails a day
interesting so you have to sit there and talk crap it's kind of cool when you get to this level because you have all these women just saying you're the king of the
world you're the king of the world they know everything about you so if you want to go on a date you just scroll through the pictures and go okay you this time
this place and they'll show up and you'll just sit there and I'll usually come with the guys because we'll be
doing something else I'll just bring them along by proxy like oh we got a poker game so you just nice to meet you
okay but you would would you be interested more about the W just the way they look on Instagram my my my point is
they they know everything about me already and they're already in loveing me so I don't have to talk to that unless I want to thought you would have
talked to it sometimes sometimes I else but it's kind of cool it's just like but
is that it's done it's already it's all done is that not too easy that's not war for you maybe you need to really fight for all and have war and then appreciate
them I have enough Wars the last thing I need but you said everything is a war it is is it is you're right so wom are too
easy for you well that exactly so so I've retired it's conquered it's done it's done it's done there's a woman
alive I couldn't say you know what you're beautiful this time this place and she wouldn't show up and i' like okay very nice to meet you my wife
wouldn't good and we've had this cuz we've had hours of convers of me coming out here because she's in love with you
so she shouldn't right but my point is if I got to if I decided I wanted to court a female I would have choices and
I wouldn't have to sit and date effectively because you get to a certain level of status where they're just
chasing you and that's fine and I'm I'm not saying this in a in a horrible way at all in fact I actually really like it
and I actually really respect when a woman will turn up and she knows everything about me and she likes me and she wants to be with me and it's all done it's a done deal good nice to meet
you nice to meet you done deal pom cool and I just get to play poker with my friends and Stu that's cool but I've
settled down but um so will you be flipping when you said 11 wives or have you got 11
wives I I can't let the Matrix know everything because no because there there's always going to be it's all
attack vectors I have to I have to smoke screen because it's all attack vectors and and
the largest attack Vector for a man will always be women I don't know if most men understand this that the easiest way to
get a man in any regard is a woman because women have basically no opsc in
general two explain no upsc sorry they have no operational security they have no obsc so if my brother and I go
somewhere I know that unless I want people to know I'm there no one will know I'm there if we bring either of our
girlfriends sooner or later corner of a cup on an Instagram story or or piece
the books yeah yeah that's right yeah do I get that one yeah no that's true but they knew where
I lived anyway I didn't get rated for pizza they knew EX where I was but women aren't very good at operational security
firstly secondly women are easy to scare as they should be so if you need to your
woman can love you with all her heart but if they want to find out where you are and they kidnap your wife she's going to tell them yeah of course she is
if the police interviewer her she's going to tell them of course she is women women are the attack vector and I'm talking about this from a law
enforcement perspective I can also talk about it from my previous life if I had an enemy and I wanted to get hold of it
and I couldn't get hold of it or I couldn't find it we just find a trick she'll tell us or or you at least
watch her she'll give it up every single time she'll make a mistake because women don't have this combative mentality and
I wouldn't want a woman who does cuz that's a man cuz that's a man you don't want a man woman you want a woman so I'm
not I'm not being misogynistic I'm saying that the kind of woman I like who's truly feminine who I'd want to be
with is a primary target it law enforcement know this too law law enforcement will arrest a man let's
let's make up a hypothetical situation hypothetical let's imagine there's a guy called top t top T is arrested top T is
accused of human trafficking he's accused of human trafficking because he told two of his friends while hours to post on Tik Tok Matrix attack garbage
the law enforcement know it's garbage everybody know it's garbage the primary objective in this hypothetical story is
to put the man in jail use the media machine to slander him and to drum up a real case because he's now in jail
they've got some months to find something real because all they have now is Tik Tok stupid so they call all of
his ex-girlfriends or every girl he's ever interacted with and they sit down and say were you a victim of Andrew and they say a victim of what he never did
anything to me he never hurt he never hit me ah but did he manipulate you what does that mean manipulate me to do what
he took me to dinner what do you mean manipulate then what they do is they bring out a league table in this
hypothetical situ scenario they bring out literally a league table a spreadsheet after going through this
imaginary person's bank accounts saying well where did he take you for dinner here oh where else did he take you here
here here okay that he spent maybe I don't know 8,000 EUR on you do you know he bought this girl this do you know he
spent this much on this girl do you know he went here with this girl and he'll put together a league table with financials next to each name almost like
the Premier League you're number 13 watch her sit there and go I loved
him I'm Number 13 why'd that get diamonds that that's the beginning of
the six-hour interview and they'll pressure her and try and get her to agree to some manipulation or she was
just because she was sad they don't care if it's real they just want the signature so women are the attack Vector
so if you're a man with any kind of past and they get their league tables in order and they get their stories in
order and they got their surveillance photos of when you went to the same restaurant with the girl she doesn't like and they get it all together they
start putting it down in front of you that woman who you took care of who you spent time with who was very happy with
your interactions Who Loved You is now being weaponized against you women are
the number one attack Vector for a man by law enforcement and by your enemies if you're a man out here and you have
you're dating three or four women please understand that if I was the police or if I wanted you dead we would look at
those three or four women and re and work out how to use them against you that's the bottom line does that does
that me you struggle to open up to women because of the threat of that are you closed to
them I me I I am I'm
cautious because so maybe you're not giving them the full year no it's not that I'm doing them a
favor that that line I'm doing them a favor I am yeah I'll tell you
why you take the average chick but I'm I'm asking about you though yeah I am I'm talking about me take the average
Shick and say you were going to have to go through a 6-hour interview with federal agencies and you're going to
have to not make a single mistake and not give away a single detail and
perhaps you're going to have to obscure or lie by Omission I have to be very careful so they can't get any details of
our relationship or our life so they can't destroy me and it's going to be six hours against professionals you tell
her that she'll start to panic right she'll start to worry and she'll get nervous which means she's going to do even worse it's better if she doesn't
know anything to tell I'm doing her a favor when they sit down and say how how does Andrew make money she goes you know
well I've been all around the world on private jets I don't know but does sound not ruin your intimacy not I'm
protecting her I'm protecting her because she no longer has to sit there and go okay I know he does this this and this what if they asked me about this
this and this what if they already know what if they had no she she doesn't know so it's easy can you share anything
about who you are of course they know they know who I am I'm a man who takes care of my people and I'm a man who
never fails I'm a man who's brutally competent you ask any of my wives where my bank account is in which country they
couldn't tell you and that's good for them I'm protecting them so now they even going lie I don't know I don't know
I have a pretty dress on that he bought me and I have no idea where it came from and that's that benefits them now but
does that not feel like you could get closer to a woman really fall in more deeply in love it's that a weakness for
you no it's not a weakness because a man falls in love I believe a Man shows love through one Finance I do believe you
give a woman money if you love her because money is the time and energy that you put into the world so I do believe that men show love via money and
I also believe we show love through protection and which is what about connection is that completely but I'm
I'm going to connect with the woman I protect if I don't protect a woman I'm not going to connect with her naturally
if I have a woman who says I don't want your protection and I don't want your rules and I'm going to do whatever I want but I'm going to connect with her if I have a woman who I truly care about
I have to look her and say I want to protect you in all Realms from everything and everyone including a police interview have you ever shown any
weakness to a woman vulnerability of cried in front of a woman no I don't cry
in general but yeah I I there certainly women I've been with for a long time know what
bothers me absolutely and you're okay with that completely but I'm saying that I'm not going to put her a
position where she needs to rely on her quick wit against a federal agency or her quick wit
against anybody else I think that would be irresponsible for me as a man why would I do that I think the most
responsible thing I can do is is to have my woman live a princess life and be taken care of and for us to be in love
and if she ever ends up under pressure she defaults to the truth because people say women are fantastic Liars I'd argue
the opposite I think women are terrible Liars no woman's ever managed to lie to me it takes 3 seconds to tear their lies apart 3 seconds so women can't lie so
just sit there and tell the truth and the truth is I don't know I don't know I
don't know I don't know I don't know and they just I don't know their way through it that's me being pro that's me being
responsible for the same reason I won't let my toddler put her finger in a plug socket I'm not going to tell a woman where I do my banking she doesn't need
to know and if she for some reason finds that detrimental to our connection then I guess she's going to have to go find
another f billionaire isn't she but she'll probably struggle cuz there's not
many of us so she's going to have to just deal with it are you really a billion there like really yes I'll tell
you why yeah so let's it's interesting because because I think you've turned over billions but I don't think you got
a net worth of a billion well how do you calculate net worth net worth is semi subjective would you
agree the assets minus liabilities okay so we have assets minus liabilities but then let's say your assets are companies
or let's say your assets are a brand then it becomes subjective yeah well it becomes what someone will pay for it at the time if you sell it okay which isn't
subjective in the moment oh well that's right but I've never tried to sell my companies but then but a lot of people go oh my company's worth a billion it's
actually worth correct you're completely right so this is why I'm talking about how it's subjective so then what you can
do is you can go online and you can look at previously sold or multipliers multipliers that's right so let's say
let's say I had a tech company let's say I had an online educational platform that turned over $150 million a year at
8 % profit let's say mhm and let's say in the real world let's say you did
let's say I had that yeah right and then you would say well the standardized Tech multiplier is six or seven especially
with a margin like that well that's a billion dollar company but it's not it's not a personal billion dollar net worth
well it's a billion dollar company that's owned by me Tristan has no share in it shares shares you're thinking
inside the matric shares shares there no shares Shar schares no one owns it on
paper it just exists it's just there if I needed if I if I sold
everything I owe for the fair price I would have a lot more than a billion dollars if you want if you want to talk
about hard assets like real estate Cars Land let's do that let's let's do that then how how much real estate have you
got the Matrix is after me they're try they they took everything from me decot
took it all you said to me everything you told me to come to Romania and bring everything but decal took everything of
course but I actually worked this it's funny you asked me this question because my brother and I worked this out only a
week and a half ago we were like if you know what you have you ain't got much what do we have but Sur you track your
net worth every year no because if I want something you cannot Master what you do not measure if I want something I
just buy it if I want a $5.4 million Pagani to go with a Pagani Penthouse
that cost $29 million then I just buy both I just buy them buy that I just
send a message because they important to the competent Authority purchase and
it's done I have hundreds of millions of dollars of real estate right but I'm not going to say where it is I didn't ask
you that though I wouldn't ask you I have hundreds of millions of dollars of real estate well no sorry let me rephrase that there is a company owned
by a company owned by a trust fund owned by a company that has hundreds of millions of dollars of real estate which I have access to okay and um how many
cars do you currently have 59 I think I bought another one yesterday what was that it was only a
Huracan Technic but it was the last one off of the production line so I thought I'll buy it so what's the 59 cars worth
well let's try and work this out I have a RAC Nea is that on order no it's finished just he's collecting but yeah
I'm on judicial control I cannot leave Romania that's around 5 million I have the bagatti around 5 million I have two
two Jas ordered they were 5 million each I got Jesco that's 5 million so that's
five cars are already at 30 million why two Jers because I expect did and I couldn't
decide which color it was it was between the two and I thought well I'm not a
broy and po it right it what's the kig zeg process of buying it must be a pain
in the ass like I guess it wait list all that for the average man perhaps yeah
when you're Andrew Tate when you look at what I've done for the Bugatti brand
think about it do they like you well I don't know maybe they don't like me in traffic or whatever but I guarantee the word Bugatti has been said more in the
last two years that was ever said in its entire history if I say to C like I want JIS they're like yes sir so they like
you I I think so yeah there are there any car brands that won't sell to you no of course are there any watch brands
that won't sell to you everyone loves me Rob this is the S off there's a s off
that I'm some disliked person every single person likes me all of the time I've never I've yet to have a negative
interaction there must be one pissed off girlfriend ex-girlfriend that doesn't like you no one is liked by everyone I'm
sure decot tried very hard to find her I mean that was their job right we just discussed their entire attack Matrix
they they interviewed 2,000 women who disliked me and I'll say this also right here I think this is might be a world
exclusive I'll make this clear my first file is almost dead now because it's
garbage de call have a second file that they've been working on for a very long time so when I first got out of jail
when the judge released us from house arrest the judge read the file and said this is stupid and released us from
house arrest that day a new file started and new interviews with girls began so
DEC call have a second file so if I continue to win they're going to hit me again I so this is your life basically
oh completely yeah they're going to continue to hit me am I ever going to get out Romania I don't know but they've
been interviewing girls for that now the girls I know who have gone have all called me after saying these people are crazy they were trying they tried
everything to get me to sign a victim paper and I wouldn't sign it those are the girls who told me after they left
but those are the girls I have good relationships with did a girl go who I have forgotten about and sign a paper
saying she's a victim of I don't know being bought too many nights dinners and then and then not call me after and will
I find out about that when they come and raid my house again and throw me back in jail cell with the second file
perhaps Life Is War what can you do my friend I'm a 37y old man I'm also exceptionally handsome I have
ex-girlfriends that's life and at my at my Echelon they're going to attack you
by the females you know and I'll argue here there's not a single 37y old man you can find on the planet that doesn't have a p off ex-girlfriend somewhere so
yeah do I probably you accept your ex's well no the point is that that's why
this attack Vector is so deadly that's why it's so effective if they sit a woman down again
hypothetical scenario top te one of his girlfriends gets called goes to there
sits down she calls him after and says they were telling me that if I'm a
victim I get compensation from you when you're found guilty if I'm a witness in your defense I have to pay my own legal
fees and they were trying to tell me I need €100,000 to Def just to not be a victim but I'll get paid money if I am a
victim now that is a lie but that's what the authority were telling these girls
to try and get them to sign pieces of paper to try and destroy my life in this second file this imaginary second to
imaginary M so is that scary yeah do I have ex-girlfriends who are pissed off
of me probably have they been found by authorities and track down and pressured into signing pieces of paper saying
they're victims of God knows what maybe you can go deeper down the rabbit hole
what is human trafficking I was be interested talk about this all the time we're like okay so we're accused of
human trafficking because they're saying that we told girls to post on Tik Tok at
certain times so we controlled them via the lover boy method which means we
controlled them via being nice so we were nice to people and nicely asked them to nicely post on Tik Tok to steal
the money from Tik Tok right that's human trafficking how is any boss of any
company not a human trafficker do you nicely ask your staff to do something at a particular time sometimes I not very
nicely ask them to do something well you're in a laot of trouble sir cuz do you do that for financial gain of course
is that person a woman sometimes Jil you have a penis she's a vagina you influenced her and
manipulated her she has no sovereignty at all over her own decision try to cancel me sir you are human but this is
the bull it's complete bullsh so then you sit there and go okay well how did I manipulate her well
because you're a man and she's a woman well then you're a misogynist because you're saying women have no agency and
can't make their own decisions why can't a woman say I've just decided I want to listen to this man as my boss and make
money or I've decided not to do as this man says you're saying that women have no control over their own minds and
every single thing a man says to them they obey like slave robots so you're a misogynist you are calling women stupid
so why am I under attack for being a misogynist for believing that a woman can work for a company and decide if she
wants to do what she's supposed to do on time or not how does it make me a misogynist are you
angry I am amused I'm deeply amused I am deeply amused by
the state of this world I think there's anger in there oh no I'm an angry person
because anger is a fuel and that's how I get so much done but I'm not angry in a
negative sense I actually think anger is a fantastic feeling to have I would be worried about myself if I wasn't angry
I'm angry all the time yes but I was angry before all this garbage but I'm just I'm genuinely amused at the state
of the world where we're going to have this hypocritical frame of society where
women are Perpetual victims everything a man does to them wasn't their fault and every single decision they make was a
man's fault at some point because five years ago they had sex with a guy which they now regret which is the man's fault it wasn't their decision and they're
victims who should be protected and believed in all regards and if a man does anything to them he's a human trafficker at the same time they're
fierce and independent and they're equal to men in fact better than men in everything and we've put these two frams
together at in the same society and we're sitting here going so if if the
truth is if a woman can't be trusted to make her own decision she should be listening to her father I I guess but
they're saying no women don't listen to their fathers they're independent they can do what they want okay well she's independent she can do what she want she decided to become a star like M Khalifa
did and then when she regrets doing she starts doing videos saying my manager
tricked me that's what happened if your manager
could convince you to do wasn't she making hundreds of Millions on onlyon oh yeah she make so did he tricker into
that of course he did yeah so if your manager can trick you into having sex with 300 men for hundreds of millions of
dollars over a period of six years oops then per then perhaps you should do as
your dad says but at the same time you think you're too smart to listen to your father which one is
it Society needs to make its mind up the whole thing is a joke and all of it is
done on purpose and it's all done on purpose to deliberately attack masculinity it's not safe to be a man
anymore you can't be a man and have normal relations with women in any
regard without it being used against you if they so wish every single man
watching this podcast is guilty you are all human traffickers you're all manipulative you're all controlling
you're all emotionally abusive all of you can go to jail if you off the government enough and they will find
some girl who said he emotionally cered me because he wouldn't let me go
drinking with a bunch of men and he I felt controlled and she'll do a domestic
violence report even though you've never touched her for controlling behavior and they will drag you to a police interview
and sit you down they will then take your mobile phone they will go through your phone and find every other girl
you've ever spoken to see if they can get some other statements against you they'll also find the time you sold your
t-shirt on eBay and didn't pay taxes and you sir are going to jail all of you are
guilty if you are a man you are guilty of everything all of the time and this is done on purpose because if you're a
man like me who stands up and tells the truth they already know you're guilty so they're like oh okay he's guilty of
something teach him a lesson you're living in a state of society as a man now where you're all permanently your
heads on the chopping block and the only way you can not have the Gil come down and take it off is to be quiet and meek
and not to talk too much don't tell the truth no and that's the world we're living in now and the crazy thing about
it is crazy truly crazy this is the crazy thing I'm getting cred [ __ ] the crazy thing is
this I say all of this and 70% of people sit there and go yeah it's true if you're a man you're perfetly guilty and
they they keep it all over your head and they try and make you scared to tell the truth because they'll punish you there are still 30% of people out there who
believe this Andrew Tate became the most famous most Googled man in the world
speaking against government and Authority but they didn't put him in jail for that they put him in jail
because of tick tock because he's a human trafficer there are people that
stupid and these people get to vote these people are usually the ones they put on the news these people run the
liberal NOS these people are teachers these people are lawyers people are police officers you want to talk about
how messed up Society is sit me down with the average police officer and let me talk to him for 5 minutes and I'll
prove to you conclusively that they are stupid all of them and they're in charge
of your life these people give me the average primary school teacher on a Monday morning after she'd been drinking
all weekend sleeping with God knows who and let's sit her down and see who's educating our children whole world's a
mess and these people will sit there go yeah man's a human tribe I think human traff cuz the BBC told me oh the BB the
BBC told you oh well it must be true clown World clown world is no longer
safe to be a man on any level so when you ask me because I like to go back to previous points we made I think it's
nice to be cyclical you ask me about the fact that am I afraid they're going to put bullet in my head they're going to
put bullet in all our heads do you understand at least I get to die first at least they remember my name if we we
all have to jump off the cliff at least I get to go first wait wait Lads what
Andrew Tate went first cuz we're all going to die the only way to stay alive
as a man now is to not be a man anymore to be a chick and be afraid because men
are little cowards oh don't kill me no okay I refuse I refuse absolutely just
shoot me or put me back in jail it's fine I refuse until the day I'm I'll drive my Ferrari around I'm going say
whatever want that's what's going to happen don't give I don't care anymore put me in jail
put me back in jail I don't care I worked out something that's actually very fantastic for everyone at home
who's worried about going to jail to all the men at home because they're going to come for all of us if you have any kind of opinion or your tell your girlfriend not to sleep with other men somehow that
makes you controlling if you go to jail you can still smoke which means there's nothing the
government can really do to you that prevents you from getting cigarettes so life's fun
cigarettes is life is it I mean cup of coffee cigarette push-ups that's jail that's life that's
all I do I'm a billionaire that's all I basically do train smoke to my brother
yeah it's it's the same at least I'll be in the goog with a pure heart and a pure
Soul you know I'll be in the goog looking out the window at all these other men walking around in Freedom and
they'll feel sorry for me and I'll feel sorry for them like no because you're not free you know
this cigar thing though yeah like cuz obviously I have a lot of mutual connections you like just seems like you
sort of suck in you just like the e no no no no sir I mean I can't I'll
actually talk about the cigar I have to smile in photos I know that's like sacr no and I can't smoke cigars I just can't
I understand that and and let let me talk about the cigar thing what am I missing well I do believe that nicotine
is is very good for you that might be a controversial belief I think it actually I think science has agreed that nicotine
overall is pretty good for you it's the delivery vehicle that can be bad for you smoking but I've seen into the future I
don't get cancer I'm adate it's just not the way it's going to go so I'm not scared of that so I do
believe that there's massive health benefits to smoking cigars however I don't is that why you smoke them because
there's massive health benefit they make me stronger yeah before like before I Spar at the house like before we're going to do 12 rounds of fight I'll Have
a Cigar to power me up of course 100% it's all on video so yeah I
do believe smoking makes me stronger however I will argue this point I do think it is to ju toos of things that
makes them interesting do you think do you think do you feel responsible for saying that bear in mind probably a lot of people are now going to smoke 40 a
day before doing getting just the point I'm gonna go into I think it's a justos of things that make them interesting so
if if someone wants to start smoking cigars because of me I would argue which would be a lot of people well well then if they don't look
like I do they're a fool the reason me smoking cigar is cool is because I'm in better physical condition than
most Olympic athletes I look better than most Olympic athletes I'm on zero steroids zero drugs of any kind I take
zero protein powders I don't take creatine nothing I eat steak I smoke cigars I drink coffee that's what I do
you know one your best friends called me gay for ordering broccoli I have nothing against broccoli no but he called me gay
should pun I should have done he's an X UFC F thought I think I know who you I
know who you mean um but if you're in fantastic physical condition you smoke a cigar it's cool if
you're fat ass shape and smoke a cigar it's not cool so I think it's a justtin position of things that make it context
yeah it's context like I I smoke a big F cigar but I also look like an Olympic Olympic Athlete if I lost all my
physical conditioning and lost my body and lost my prowess would I stop smoking yes so I gu yes to smoke cigars you
should earn it and if you start if you could run a marathon like I could right now without without anything give me
shoes I'll run a marathon if you can fight 15 rounds you can kick the [ __ ] out people then you can have a cigar of
course I'm sure LeBron James or whatever could smoke a cigar I'm sure Ronaldo can smoke cigar he
Ronaldo but if you're not in that if you're not in that shape then you shouldn't be smoking them the cigar should be earned so I'm allowed because
I'm superhumanly strong I'm allowed because I'm a superhero the last
superhero the current superhero of Earth for all the children is Andrew tatee I
am the superhero so I'm allowed and if you're not superhero you're not allowed though there done done officialized
officialized uh so yeah I I I think but I do think smok's good for you overall okay so when we were talking before I
came out here you said you are pissed off with yourself because there's things you really wanted to say and you didn't
or couldn't say them whether it was Lawyers advice or and you said to me I'm going to say them to you rob yeah what
are those things you know what's interesting I don't think it's necessarily the things I say I think
it's the way I think them for a while a lot of people think I'm crazy
they don't realize I'm actually heavily sanitized myself like I have sentences
in my head that I've had to deconstruct and reconstruct into a sanitized manner most people are not ready for me to say
things the way I truly think them and I've been so far being a bit more open
than I've had to be previously and I also want people at home who are watching this to appreciate the risk I'm taking even
doing a podcast like in my legal situation I'm not supposed to be talking to anybody by anything PR lawyers
everyone's sit and say Andrew just shut up until you get out of this but that's what they want me to do it's maybe on
let me self analyze let's you can be my psychotherapist and what were you pissed off about yourself because no I'm pissed
off because maybe part of me I don't know if it's
the masculine essence or I don't know if it's the childishness you know when someone says don't touch that
ball want to grab it so you know when you come out of jangle and they're like don't do podcast don't make fun of the
police don't tell them you won't shut up don't say women can't park Andrew it's very important don't you're like and you
think about it there's definitely a part of that in me I don't know if I'm childish I don't
know if I'm I don't think it's arrogance I think also there's a masculine Essence to it don't tell me what to do
so I'm pissed off because I'm I'm very constrained for a year and a half my
life has been constrained by extension the things I can say have been constrained and not only things I can
say but the way I say them has been constrained and I feel very frustrated with that it's very frustrating but I'm
I'm start so I constrain yourself right here right now well I am and I'm doing my best but I'm trying to also be
diligent because I would like to delay my return to the
dungeon it wasn't a particularly fun time it wasn't a nice place to be I've accept it I'll I'll go back I think
that's the best mental model to have I can either be pleasantly surprised or correct two good
options but um I'm trying to delay it but it is annoying to see certain things
and think certain things and have certain observations because that means they're winning why did they do this to
me to shut me up so if I shut up even 5% they won I'm letting my enemies win do
you understand how that hurts my my soul yeah because there's still things here you're not saying I can sense it yeah
and but then you have to understand that per perhaps well now you know the
consequences of saying them it's not even the consequences perhaps the most intelligent thing for me to do with my
masterful iido is to just continue to coil the spring and to Allure to certain
ideals or to give to give Whispers of certain truths
that I know and then everybody becomes Ultra interested and the spring continues to
coil and then if I finally do Escape
perhaps that's the smartest thing to do is escape possible though that's a good question you know it's kind of
interesting what is V what someone decided who has more power than someone
else yeah so it's a personal opinion because if law well there's a universal law which you can't break and there's a
human law which are manipulat unbreakable I love that and you're completely right and these human laws
the reason you need lawyers and judges and stuff to to decipher them it's
because they're subjective what is law it's just someone in a room it's kind of interesting the whole world works that
way what is education someone in a room deciding something what is government someone in a room deciding something
what is a company someone in a room giving orders what is law someone in a room who's in that room what did they
decide what even is any of this all of it is so subjective it's all smok and
mirrors so it it is it's a very interesting experience because I actually I'm going to give
some credit to the Romanian state with some of the decisions I've seen in the west now I feel like I have a fairer
Shaw in a Romanian Court than I would in an American Court like what I think Trump just had to paid $90 million some
woman who lied something insane so with all this then you start to go down the
ra okay so which courts are fair so do you think you'd be more if in the UK with people with what's going with
Russell Brown and people like that well the UK government hates me they talk about me in Parliament members of
parliament stand up I mean they tried to ban you for the entire school system is right they stand up members of parliament stand up and say I'm Public
Enemy Number One not the knife crime not the stabbings not the robberies not the drug dealers not the Range Rovers that
go missing 10 times a night no Andrew Tate said women can't park put him in
jail so then you have ask yourself well if members of parliament hate me and talk about me in question time would I
get a fair chance in a UK Court do you think I'd get a fair
shot I I think that's why you're in Romania personally well then who told Romania to do this to me so you don't
think Romania is doing this to you the rabbit hole is deep Whispers of the truth the coiled
spring for the big explosion the big explosion
of I want to push you by don't because I respect the fact you're giving me a lot of time yeah um but I've got to do my
job haven't I oh absolutely but I'm just saying that you you when you end up in a position like mine you realize how
subjective all of this stuff is well life is isn't it well life is but it's kind of funny because people have said
to me but Andrew you're innocent you have a lawyer I'm like are you are you
dumb like they think a lawyer innocence they think these have anything to do
with a matrix attack doesn't matter if you're a lawyer it doesn't matter if you're innocent it doesn't matter what the law says that has nothing to do with
a matrix attack at a certain level the judicial system just becomes a play
maybe if you're insignificant you're a nobody you can walk but if I walk there are massive repercussions for countries
for federal agencies there's repercussions that Spam The Globe EV
andate Walks from this Matrix attack so then you have to sit down and decide if you're in charge of all this would you
rather the reputation of a country and the reputation of its Federal agency be decimated or would you rather one man do
a couple years what makes more sense because the world's not fair life's not fair there
is no justice besides Gods none of it's real right so then you have to also
understand so just quick sorry just jump in you say that like it's their fault but you also own that everything you
said brought you here so what which is it are you responsible for you going to jail for everything you said or are they
responsible for being the Matrix and trying to control you well that's a good question but I will answer I'm
responsible because that's my mental model for everything whether I am truly completely responsible or not is a
different debate however my mental model is every single thing that happens to me is my fault all of it if it rains it's
my fault that's how much control I want over my life because if it's not my fault I don't have control over it if
you want to absolve responsibility then you absolve authority over it and that's what a lot of men make the biggest
mistake oh it wasn't my fault well now you can't fix it so it's my fault it's my fault I didn't have to be so
devilishly handsome you can't help that but you can't help what you said you can't help how you but
there's also a huge I'll make this very clear there is a huge degree of jealousy wrapped up in this Matrix attack if I
was some short little dork and broke and said the same things nobody would care but because I remind these nerds of the
guy who picked on them in school because I'm big and tall and strong and smart and women love me and I have a bagat e a bunch of cars hundreds of millions of
dollars property and in a private jet and a y'all because I live the dream life of every man a bunch of people are pissed off at me and they want to put me
in jail of course there's a huge degree of that I didn't have to be so monumentally successful and Brash but I decided to be
so I take responsibility for all of it and also I'm not a perfect person if I go to jail for this garbage which I know
I've done nothing wrong but I do know I have done things wrong in my life so all in all fair enough me and my brother
kept saying that to each other in jail all in all fair enough you know we're here for some garbage complete garbage
yes but when we were 19 and we were drinking wkds in liquid nightclub and
that guy bumped into us and we were a bit drunk and he ran his mouth and we took his teeth out was that necessary
really or were we young and stupid we were young and stupid and we hurt some guy bad so all in all Cosmic Justice put
me with the Cockroaches whatever I'm not a perfect person I'm also not a coward I'm Not Afraid yeah it would be but I'll
get stories I'll come out and do podcast what what what am I supposed to do so I'll take responsibility for it
but I also understand why there's people in rooms right now sitting there
frustrated that I'm not in jail because these people are analyzing my life forensically and they're like damn I
I'll never be him I will never have a fraction of his capability or his Finance the way these women stick up for
him and adore him my wife would never stick by me like that I hate him I I get
it I totally get it and that's my fault for being so why why do people
hate things that they see in others that they actually want themselves well I
think that Envy is designed to motivate but the Matrix has taken envy and it's
corrupted it so I I've always been I've told this story on other podcasts before but I've been an envious person I've
told this story because it was so pertinent to me about how most people don't care I was walking to school I was
walking to six storm College L I was 16 177 years old and I used to have to walk about an hour each day to school and it
was raining and I was walking and I was walking with three of my friends and a Ferrari it was a F430 I think pulled up
at the that was my Ferrari that pulled up at the lights made a bunch of noise
and I was standing there and I watched it and then the light went green and he tore off I said to my friends I was like
bro how do we get Ferraris and he's like what do you mean I was like my mom is on
a council estate single mother she raises three kids on 300b a month I can
we can barely afford food he has 200 grand for a car liquid for a
car something is broken none of the teachers at school have Ferraris none of
the our University professors have Ferrari no one else I know has a Ferrari what do we have to do to break the
Matrix and and find the money this is all a lie I want a Ferrari and my friends were like don't know that's why
I have fer friends well no that's why I have Ferraris and they don't that's why I now have 33 Ferraris because I wanted
I was envious I was envious of this man most people don't care but you turned
Envy into learning how to figure it out well I turned I turned Envy into anger and anger is power but what we have
people doing now because people are because they don't believe in themselves because the Matrix is
dampened their soul when they feel envious because they want to level the playing field which is all Envy is
instead of trying to elevate themselves they try and drag others down so when people look at my life and they're envious of me what they should say is
he's truly from the most humble possible socioeconomic Beginnings he is a person
of color from a council estate a single mother household he is the bracket of
criminal human trafficker he's at the bomb and he made
it up to the highest s launch he's on the phone with Elon Musk and is a billionaire he can do it I can do it but
they don't believe in themselves so what they do instead is I want to level the playe field so I got to drag him down
and they do that primarily through character assassination that's what they're going to do well he has all these things but he's a bad person I'm a
good person and it's the Matrix they don't believe in themselves anymore so Envy
when you're trying to drag others down is actually it's just laziness because you feel envious but you don't have
enough fire about yourself to go out there and attack the world and equal the playing field with Vigor so you want to
equal the playing field with by dragging some someone else down it's just laziness lazy people act that way people
who are not lazy would see me as an inspiration but inspiration is only Envy it's all it is so I think humans are
designed to be envious and I think the correct mental model for Envy is inspiration and the incorrect mental
model for NB is going to be attempting to attack someone's character and I
think I guess I guess it's is a survival mechanism if you see your opponent has
three rocks and you only have two you want four otherwise you're going to lose is that why you have 59 cars well
in case I might have to race my friend you said you only drive four of them I've only got seven but they're all in
the garage at the same time I'm joking no but you know what bet
most of you in a circle haven't got as many cars as I have Oh no you're completely right and and and but they all go wrong with the time and only one
or two of them actually want to drive correct and it's funny cuz I have so many of the same car like I have three
sf9 all three of a currently have a warning light I have four 765 only one of them's working bro so yeah it's a
nightmare and then you've lost it for a month because it's got to go back to the garage and then it's a 25 Grand bill for a correct gearbox you don't need correct
it is a nightmare the reason I buy so many cars is because I'm passionate about cars and I guess you say I'm very
hard on myself but I like to spoil myself with cars because I can't think of another way to spoil myself clothes
okay you buy a wardrobe of clothes how many clothes do you really need diamond watches okay I had 30 diamond watches four let me ask you about it what's
what's there to buy besides cars please you're another very high net worth individual please correct me because I
buy a new car every week and I'm because I'm bored what else is am I supposed to buy with all my money yeah cars watches
clothes assets assets is work experiences are
great but I'm locked in remaining you need to buy cars nothing else to do I bought like 40 cars since I got out of
jail there's nothing 30 cars whatever have you bought a lot since coming out of jail oh yeah so is this a reaction to
it it's like you know what's funny when they raided my house the first thing the police said is where's the Bugatti first
words it's almost like the Romanian State just wanted to steal money interesting anyway back to jail um when
they raided my house I have a safe and I have all my diamond Watchers in a safe on a spoolie thing and it's bulletproof
glass and B and they're like open the safe and I was like what happens if I don't open and Mr ski Mas with the
shotgun he says well you're going to jail so it doesn't matter if it takes us 3 months with a chainsaw we're getting
in that safe and we're going to destroy your house while we do it I was like well that's a pretty valid
point time is the fire in which we all burn including a safe I mean it can hold someone out for a certain amount of time
but I'm sure with months of time they'd get in so I opened the safe and they took all my watches I had 30 diamond
watches collection and so what millions of pounds left millions of pounds yeah and my first phone call from jail I
think that's the universe of universe's way of saying don't ruin a nice watch with all those diamonds ruin what do you
mean but you've got a lovely PCH Nautilus there correct yeah and you like you think it's ruined yeah keep it
natural you know what you know what this is that that's like a woman plastered with cosmetic surgery brother this this
is this is just because I'm half black you don't understand no I don't the icing I get we have powers maybe you can
educate me you need some some danceall so I when they took when they took all
my watch collection the first phone call I made from jail was to a friend of mine in Dubai and I said I want them all
again call X he'll pay the bill $11 million I want them all again so I got
duplicates of them all made again because I slept better in bed knowing that I had them all again made and now
they're all made and they're in Switzerland in a safe waiting for me all made if I get them back from decall
that'd be fantastic then I have two of everyone maybe I can wear one diamond watch on each wrist that'll piss you off
piss me there go ruined the lovely one don't worry the one on each wrist but um
what about doing that yeah there's nothing else to do with money that's the reason I buy cars there's literally nothing else to do people have this idea
that they got rich they buy all this stuff but truthfully what do you need you need a phone and a laptop you need a place to live that's life and then uh
you buy you have some clothes you have some watches and you have some cars and that's it there's literally nothing else to buy so I just buy them all because I'm doing okay that's it that's why and
seven cars is actually a very responsible sensible number of cars to have you're a very responsible sensible
I don't know I one anymore I think I'm like for me too many women I can handle 11 wives I can't handle
one yeah Seven's a good number it is and and yeah I guess I'm just uh let me say
your response what's the wrong word you hedonist no I don't think I am but I
don't know if you they don't see seek any pleasure from it's not like I spoil myself with cars I I feel like I if I'm
going to go through all this stress and all this pain so it's a representation of your selfworth of yourself I feel I'm worthy and I want to reward myself I
just feel I I you know what I don't even drive them I just I like I think what I think it if I have to analyze it what I
truly think it is I think it's because it's most men's Dream Most men's dream is a Lamborghini let's say and they have
to save and they have to finance it and work out how they're going to pay for it and they have to get the garage for it and it's a big deal
so by me trivializing that big deal it highlights to me the echelon of my life
if I walk into a car dealer and say what have you what have you got right now oh this and this okay don't ask the price
don't don't care what it is don't care what it costs and pay for it and then leave at the dealership for four months
before eventually it collects on a truck because I never even pick it up and it goes into some storage unit
somewhere it's like I get other people's dreams with ease I take their dream
scenario and I trivialize it into just yeah okay I don't even want it and I
think that that's what I enjoy about it it's kind of like kind well it's kind of
like a man's in love with a supermodel oh I loves superm model and he writes on her Instagram and these
dudes this this is real a man's in love with a girl on Instagram she's got three million followers and she's beautiful and he's liking her post and writing
underneath it and he's inboxing her and she's not replying he's obsessed with her and I'm like yeah okay coffee fine Tuesday
do I really want to talk to her no but this man wants it so bad that I have to make it so ridiculously easy I guess
it's kind of like a peacock putting up his feathers you know or a lion saying don't come near my territory don't come
near my tree or or annihilate you it's the same in a fiscal stance so I just
take other people's dreams and I reduce them to nothing to dust and then I put
it in storage and then I forget that I even have the car most of the time till I'm reminded it needs a service and then
I'm annoyed I have it that's a headache then it gets serviced then it goes back in
storage I just I just take other maybe I'm a dream catcher I take other people's dreams take them all put them
in a big Warehouse take warehouse and then uh these people get mad at it some people some people listen to this and
are inspired by it some people get mad and those are the two camps the ones who
believe I shouldn't be in jail and the ones who rejoice when I go to jail the ones who rejoice when I go to jail though don't understand a very important
part of this whole equation is that jail makes me stronger well I was just going to say they don't understand the
balanced upside of going to jail cuz everything has a balanced upside so they think exactly they think it's bad and
you're getting all the good from it oh absolutely yeah they're like oh he went to jail haaha but it makes me a stronger
version of myself I build mental resilience more people talk about my case I become more famous than ever
before Oh for your Fame ja was the best thing for you end of all I they just did
you a massive f favor thank you have you seen Star Wars no oh okay well I'll say
it then but there's a there's a scene where one of the Jedi obiwan canobi is fighting the evil Darth Vader and he
puts his lightsaber up and he goes strike me down I will become more powerful than you could possibly imagine
and that's exactly what happened to you you became far more powerful because they struck you down absolutely so they
themselves well exactly there's no light without dark but a lot of that isn't luck a lot of that is will you watch
that Star Wars say now I will never watch Star Wars in my life not even for me I can't you I made I made a tweet
about it that went very viral a few years ago I've never seen Star Wars you didn't know about this tweet no I said
I've never seen Star Wars ever and everyone tells me I need to watch it which means I'm going to refuse to watch it I don't think you need to watch you just need to watch that scene because
you can put yourself in the scene I'll see if I can fit it in the schedule among the
wives but uh but my jail making me more powerful wasn't luck if the average
person is sitting here going ah they put Andrew in jail that's why he's famous well then you're a fool because if the average person goes to jail they don't
come out famous no cause an effect you caused it you you make your own luck you have to make your own luck in all things
the fact I called it in advance was important the fact I managed to stay
relevant while I was in jail was important the fact that I operated in a way when I was in jail that I came out
with stories was important please understand I made Mass murderers apologize to me in jail please understand if I bumped into someone or
some bumped I said sorry and they didn't say anything I brother I said sorry to you people who would kill
people so the way I conduct myself is the reason I came out of jail with certain Stories the reason I left jail
and I'm not financially destitute like they intended when you put someone in jail for three months and then lock them in their house for five months they
can't work when you seized all their bank accounts and all the assets they can find and then you put them in jail for three months and five months on
house arrest they can't leave their house the goal of that is to financially decimate you the fact that I'm still buying brand new supercars once a week
is the reason jails may be famous no one can work out how I'm doing it and I'll say it here and the people in that dark
room are like go find it find the money did did it make's the money did it make you better at managing or moving your
money being in jail having to move and manage your money well I was I was prepared for a matrix attack from the beginning but I guess now it's I've been
to the test and I've been okay I've always understood that anything you have on your name you don't own and and anything you think you own is just a
piece of paper and all the judge has to do is stamp another piece of paper and you don't own it so own nothing control everything that's the goal M so I was
prepared for all this so jail made me famous yes because I was prepared for it well you'd already made yourself famous
before jail completely but also if if I had left jail mentally broken and financially broken it wouldn't have made
me more famous so and and physically broken because all those three things could have happened please understand I
was in 24-hour a day lockdown my cell was half the size of this room and I didn't leave I didn't get a gym I didn't
come out looking all scrawny I didn't get good nutrition I didn't get good food I had most people in there had
mental health problems if I would have come out there all skinny and mentally broken then it would have been game over so there's there's also a degree of my
competence in all things but the people who laugh at me going to jail don't understand that there's no light without
dark and I'm an expert I guess if you were to say one of my skills is my I'm an expert at being hard on myself and if
life's going to be hard on me I'm going to iido that into Power I would believe I'm a stronger version of myself post
jail and if you put me back I'll emerge stronger than ever before send me to
jail fine send me to jail right now I'll go I'm not going to
fight put me in anost send me to Jail the day you let me out I'll be a stronger version of the day I went in so
what do I have to fear because if you truly want an exceptional life this is one of the mistakes a lot people make
they want an exceptional life but they only want the exceptional good because they're cowards like I want a law of
money and fast cars cool you don't want the exception stress you want the
exceptional car collection you don't want the exceptional stress you want to be me when I'm flying my Bugatti on A380
and I'm In First Class Emirates and my batti is below me and I'm filming it for day confidential you want that but you don't want to be me when I'm in a
Romanian dungeon but there is no like if you want the exceptional good you're going to have the exceptional bad that
is a law of the universe that can't be broken that is not human law that's universal law so if you're sitting at
home saying I want an exceptional life then you have to be prepared for both the good and the bad because if you're not prepared for the bad what's going to
happen on your Ascent to good as you begin to get anywhere something will happen some degree of stress or whatever
and it's going to derail you and you're never going to get to the highest echon so I've always been ready for the bad
I'm totally prepared for the bad I was made in the dark molded by it I'm bang
put me in the bad my whole life's been bad my whole life's been terrible I i' I've known nothing but pain so I I don't
care and and I'm not going to lie to you part of me TR truly hopes I go back
because I know what I'm 80 if I make it that long those years okay they dropped
the case what were those years spent doing I make beautiful children with beautiful women I drive beautiful cars I
stay in beautiful hotels I fly on my beautiful private my story but maybe the story be a bit
cooler I went to jail maybe I'm crazy maybe the story's cooler maybe maybe and
I kind of like that it's up to God I'm going to do my very best to not go to jail of course I'm a I'm a responsible
adult but if I lose this Matrix attack let's imagine it's all been set up from the beginning and it's all designed to
destroy my influence and they've realized my influence is not being destroyed and they've realized I'm not going to shut up and I haven't learned
my lesson and I'm still here running my mouth and they're going to put me back in the dungeon for five years six years
seven years eight years 10 years when I'm older that' be a cool story wouldn't
it what's the point being alive if you even got story yeah so I kind of like it's up in the air it's a coin flip
heads is good tails is good M it is what it is I'm Not Afraid right and I refuse
to be because that's what they want they want me to be afraid they want me to not smile and they want me to shut up so I
refuse I'm stubborn you know you're converting to Islam was that kind of like a PR stunt
absolutely not I think that it is the last religion on Earth if you believe in God you're a
Muslim what's a Christian well what's a what's a Muslim what's any other religious belief if you
do not have strong parameters because of your religious belief then you're not religious and Christians no longer have
strong parameters everyone says they're a Christian nobody acts like a Christian I don't respect it anymore and that's
why I had to revert to Islam I was raised in a Christian household my family is actually extremely religious I
live in a very Christian Nation but I don't see Christianity this is the most Christian Nation on Earth and you do see
it if I drive into the mountains you'll see nuns there's naries they have huge churches here you can see it a little
bit Romania can feel the Christian aspect to it but in general if you look at most Christian countries in the west
it's insane a man just got charged with a hate crime for removing the head of a
devil statue that satanists had put inside a church and he took the head off it and he is being charged with a hate
crime him in a Christian country and you don't talk about Christianity well now I
don't oh well there you go Christianity has lost all of its merits as a religion if you not have strong parameters of
what is right and what is wrong and if you're afraid to say them go to a Christian and say is homosexuality
allowed do you agree with it and they're going to [ __ ] foot around the question they're gonna say well you people can make their own choices God loves every
the Bible says no the Quran says no you're homophobe kran says
no done I'm not going to be part of a religion or adhere to a religion that doesn't have strict beliefs because then
it's not a religion anymore be tolerate everything you stand for nothing so there's only Islam left now I'm not
going to insult Christians I believe that there's one God this theory of mine
might give me trouble with Muslims alone Muslims also I don't know if this this is just how I view it I believe there's
one God and I believe the different religions are perhaps different languages to say the same thing you can say coffee cup in German you can say
coffee cup in English but it's still a coffee cup there're different ways to say the same things but the is but Islam
is so much stricter it's so much more respectable you can feel it so if you
truly believe in God I don't see how you could not want to be a Muslim I don't see how you can feel any pride in being
a Christian anymore and that's why I reverted not because I'd always believed
in God but I just found the language that made the most sense to me and I don't see any other language that makes
sense anymore I feel like it's very easy choice for anyone who truly believes in God and and if you don't believe in God
and the world we're currently in then I don't know what's wrong with you because God is the only one who can fix this mess so you better start believing
because you're going to need him and I guarantee can't you have faith in yourself and your ability no why not
because we're all human and we're all fible and it only takes a judge with a stamp as I can tell you to end your your
capabilities here on Earth we're going to need God to fix this mess because we're going to need a global Awakening
of Consciousness we need people to realize they've been lied to from head to toe we need paradigms to break and
when paradigms break things often get chaotic and messy and Wars come before a new paradigm is installed isn't that
just the rise and fall of Empires absolutely and and we have to hope that new paradigm being installed is better
than the old one and what we need once again is for people to love each other and care about their community and care about their children and care about one
another and if that's not God tell me what is we need God more than ever you can't replace god with anything else you
can't replace it with money you can't replace place with government and you also need God to inspire bravery if you don't believe in
God how can you be brave in the face of assassination it's only God if I had to go into the cage and fight a man and one
was an atheist and one truly believed that Allah had decided that he was going to destroy me I know who I'd choose to
fight I'd fight the atheist all day long Mr Evolution cool I'll fight him there's
there's you're going to need faith in God to win this war because it's only faith in God that's going to make you say no I believe in ex I love my family
I love where I live God wants me to tell the truth and stand up for what is Right
despite the fact I am persecuted for it we need more God why are all the people
in charge of your world trying to get rid of God if he's not their enemy that's the only thing they fear
the only thing they fear is people waking up and saying No this is wrong it is morally wrong and for that reason we
refuse they don't want that no they want to make everything subjective Islam especially Christianity used to be it
removes the subjectiveness you know what's right you know what's wrong and for anyone who also doesn't believe in
God if these religions are man-made why do they go against the wills of men a lot of them if if we're going to make
man-made religions why don't the religions tell us to do all the things we want to do and run around and sin no
so we we need God and I think that he is our last hope at this point I think the world is very fundamentally broken and
the demons operate in the shadows and Truth is light and God is truth and I think the more you speak the truth the
closer you're going to become to God and that's why I feel good inside if I sit here and tell the truth even if I know that someone's going to watch this
podcast in one of those darkened rooms and have new ammunition to put me back in my jail so I know that I know they're
going to put it in front of a judge and they're going to play the clip of what I'm laughing about the Romanian judicial system and they're gonna say look he thinks it's all a joke and they're going
to put me back in jail I believe God maybe I'm crazy let's
lighten this up we've got this new round so you're going to be episode a thousand on our show nice yeah which I think is
great cool um and we've never done this round before um so a new round and I
especially wanted to do it for you because I think for you it's going to be the hardest but the easiest nice so it's
a one word answer round one word answer yeah so put that in your cigar and smoke
it um so I'm going to say a word yeah and if you can one word and of course if
you want to break that rule you can break that rule but I'm looking for one word so what comes into your mind first
when I say War Prophet how you feel about
women protected
misogyny I don't prescribe to that Paradigm that's a difficult one for me to take answer I I don't think it's
real I think if you're perceptive I'm breaking the
rule well that was fist you were going to do that if you are a
realist you can be called lots of things by extension if you are a realist some
of your opinions will make you be called a misogynist if you are a realist some
of your opinions will be make you will make them call you homophobic if you are a realist you will sit and say if a man
breaks into my house I must defend my woman cuz she can't fight some people will call that misogynistic if you are a
realist you'll say that homosexuals can't have children and that they should be raised by a man and a woman that'll
be make you be called homophobic so when you say misogynist I will counter that and say no I am a realist and I refuse
to adhere to The Matrix propaganda that's my answer so one word that comes
to mind when I say the UK failed I knew begin with
f the BBC propaganda peers
Morgan he's honest no that's the wrong word
he's he's transparent I'm going to expand on that Piers holds no views peers is the
opposite of what you believe and he comes at you with it every single time if you believe the sky
is blue who believes the sky is green if you believe the sky is green he believes the sky is blue I don't think he tries to stab you in the back he attempts to
stab you in the chest and is his goal to start an argument to get as many views as possible by disagreeing with everything you say that's what Pierce
Morgan does I know what he's going to do I made a fool of him so it's fine that's
Pierce Morgan head to toe I don't think he truly believes half the things he says no I don't think he believes anything he says I don't think he believes anything I think he just wait
waits to hear you say something and argues with you about it kind of like a chick
next one word comes to mind Donald Trump hero he's our last hope I'm gonna expand
on this Donald Trump is the Last Hope of Western Civilization he can't stop the
Decay but he can slow it down if he doesn't win it's over if Trump doesn't
win it is done it is over game because the circumstances around him not winning
are rather to being insane and the degree
of I'm thinking because this is the stuff that's going to get me assassinated so let
me there's no way Donald Trump can't win unless something happens and if
something happens we're going to see not only a breakdown in faith of the
systems but you're also going to see a whole huge degree of cope from the people who you'd think
would be up in arms about it and over the weeks and months post his loss
they're just gonna talk big and do nothing and it's gonna be a bunch of coat and they're going to end up
adhering to the Matrix and the money and when they get the phone calls they're going to get scared and it's all going to fall apart and I think that Western
Civilization as a whole will genuinely collapse if Donald Trump does I think it's going to be
within a few months of his loss it's over because there's no way he'll fairly Mo so much there is no
way one word answer for
depression I think it's a choice we'll say Choice Christianity
bailed Rob Mo handsome there you go all
right that was a fun round yeah I mean they're very interesting they were
interesting it was hard to choose only one word but yeah it was a fun route is is there an ideology Society holds that
you think is the most damaging well they all work together in a perfect concoction so it's difficult to choose
which one is the most damaging because all of the ideologies which are being pushed by The Matrix are designed to
destroy something so you can have different diseases imagine society as a
human body one disease is aimed at destroying the hands another one's aimed at destroying the legs they're all equally important and they work together
in succinct succinct is that word I don't know if it is good and if it's not
at it please popg said so they work together to ensure that the body is
destroyed if I see an ideology being pushed in the mainstream I know that
it's destructive because everything is a lie so then you have to sit down and work out how it is destructive and
truthfully it's not that difficult to decipher feminism is also designed to do the same thing a man wants a a wife he
doesn't want a husband and feminism makes women into men effectively feminism is probably the most
misogynistic movement on Earth because what it does is it makes women into competitors with men in Realms where
they can't compete with men so it puts women in a position where they're just going to lose it tells women you can do
anything a man can do you go do it and then they just get annihilated and then we have to have diversity highers so they don't get so obviously annihilated
why would you take a woman and put her into a realm where she can't compete unless you want unless you want to see
her humiliated feminism is awfully misogynistic ideology and it's once
again designed at attacking and destroying the family unit so you can name any of these ideologies and I'll tell you why they're pushing it they're
pushing it to destroy the Baseline of society that is required for humans to build
a life in which they're prepared to protect if you destroy a Man's family
and you destroy his ability to raise his own kids and his wife to respect him and you destroy his ability to go anywhere
well then what is he he's a slave and that's what they want so all of these ideologies have different goals but they're all atran horse and that's why
every single time they try and push anything I'm instantly and utterly against it it's kind of amazing where
you don't have to be smart anymore you just have to instantly disagree with the news that's it now you're a genius when
they come and say we need more of this I guarantee you if you bet on the other side you'll be right more often than
wrong nine times attend it's become that simple because they lie so obviously and when I say these things
once again people say oh you're homophobic I'm not homophobic but I have children and it is my job to raise my
children they are not the government's children and they're not gay people's kids because gay people can't have kids
so the only reason they can have an LGBT agenda into the future is by turning other people's kids gay well they're
mine and I had them so I could raise them with my worldview and if I'm responsible for paying for them and I'm
responsible for keeping them safe and I'm responsible for all of the work that goes around them I'm responsible for making sure their mother is happy and
all the other jobs required for my children to live a happy life you don't get to decide how they think I get to
say I want them to be replicas of me in my worldview you don't get to come along and say they have to believe that me
women have penises and if I say that I am labeled as homophobic you know what's
interesting when I first got cancelled we spoke after my first cancellation which was in August my first life I was
attacked by the LGBT genda they're the first people who attacked me I woke up one day and there was about 120
different Instagram pages that put up a picture of me and a clip of me saying something like this which was homophobic with the same text about how I should be
removed from social media 120 Pages overnight in perfect synchronous synchronicity worked together to get rid
of me isn't that scary that 120 different LGBT influencers at once they
must have got the call in the in the group chat grinder put out a notification bing bing bing don't know
and they all attacked me at once and then the feminists same thing boom all at once so all these agendas that's just
proof that they're sponsored by governments anyway they're all funded by liberal NOS that's how governments work right governments have agendas they want
to push but they don't push them themselves instead they fund a think tank and that think tank is thinking about how to turn kids gay and then that
think tank attacks me so that's how it all works anyway so these agendas are are are genuinely destructive to society
but it's hard to choose which one is most destructive they're all working together on purpose even Mass
immigration I'm I'm a mixed race Muslim Reaver living in
Romania I'm not Romanian I guess I I I don't take I don't fit in any box at all
but when people are pushing for Mass immigration it's not because they care about humans and it's not because they
care about people like me who are the rich billionaires who come to the country and do good for it no they're
pushing it because they want to destroy the identity of a Nation because without the identity you're less likely to protect it we can also expand this into
even the way we build buildings anymore why did we build such beautiful cathedrals and now every single building
we build is [ __ ] well it's done on purpose we were talking about that yesterday it's done on purpose because
if you build beautiful buildings in a beautiful cathedral in a particular City the people of that City love that City and will defend that City if all the
buildings look the same whether you're in Houston or Hamburg it's the same tower blocks well then you don't care
you'll just go oh I'll just move I'll let them get away with what they want to get away with I guess I can always run away the rich people run away the poor
people are stuck there because they can't run away and they continue with their slavery all of this is on purpose none of this is an accident and they all
tie in together to be a sickness for society and Society is now currently very sick if you were to ask me well
what's worse the AIDS or the cancer or the Gang Green it's very difficult for
me to sit here and choose one I'm saying to you we're in a mess and we need a a
solution to all of them and the solution to all of them is the same thing I said it was earlier which is God because why
did we build beautiful cathedrals God why did people get married and stay married
God God was the solution to everything that's why they're trying to remove it they have to remove God so they can
attack all of these different institutions with these insane ideologies and these ideologies are weaponized virtue
I am the number one I am the number one target for weaponized virtue they take a word a virtuous
word homophobia you hate gay people you hate you hate no I love my children I
don't hate gay people I love my children don't don't start saying hate h me I'm a I'm a man of love and they take it and
it's a virtue right protecting gay people like they need protecting from me I don't interacted I they protecting me
why what if I because I because I love my kids and then they throw it at you and they pretend they're virtuous but but they're not they're just attacking
you it's weaponized virtue all of these things are these people are insane it's all weaponized it's all weaponized so
it's difficult for me to answer your question because was a good answer well yeah but but but all the ideologies are
so poisonous cuz they're not reality they're ideology well absolutely they're not reality I I did a podcast it's a
clip that should be a lot more famous where I was sitting the fresh and fit podcast I was sitting with a bunch of women and we were arguing literally
about how men and women can do the same things and women can do everything a man could do and I was being deliberately
comedic as to not decimate them absolutely intellectually I was making them laugh and telling them they're all
wrong and then an intruder tried to break in to the podcast studio and me and the other men got up primarily me I
think he was saying my name at first to go and deal with this Intruder in Miami who could have easily been armed and all
the women quite rightly got very afraid and started hiding and when I sat back
down I was like okay well that well that just proved all your garbage wrong didn't it
so all of these ideologies there another thing that's interesting about them is that they only exist in a vacuum you
only get to discuss feminism when you're living in a society where life is pretty easy in in the bare struggles of of
survival there's no time to discuss feminism or the climate or LGBT all this
garbage only exists in a vacuum and the vacuum that they're existing in is a very safe society which has been built
by heterosexual males families built by people who are going to get up and go to work built by people
who don't believe in depression or anxiety or these mental health garbage we've built a society that allows this
cancer to Foster and it's kind of sad really that the reward for building such
a beautiful Society off the backs of strong diligent hardworking men it's for them to be demonized attacked
permanently guilty under the judicial system and then told that they're bad people for holding a worldview which is
is the exact worldview they needed to hold to be useful to Su to society in the first place did you hear about the
Iceland strike no bro so Iceland which I would probably
argue don't ban me from Iceland government I'm just talking chill I
haven't even been yet they're gonna ban me they're gonna end up saying he's not allowed here I'm sure it's very nice
Iceland which I would argue is probably going to be one of the most liberal countries in the world I'd
argue I'd also argue that women are treated pretty fairly in Iceland I'd argue I mean it's not Pakistan or
something so all the women in Iceland decide to go on a strike because they don't get paid enough in Iceland where I'm sure they're
paid the same as men so 100,000 women went on strike which is a third of the population of the country for four whole
days and they went on this strike to prove I think even the Prime Minister bro they're definitely going to B me the
prime minister went on strike herself so 4 days none of the women worked a third of the entire country 0% of the female
Workforce went to work to prove how important women were do you know what happened tell me nothing the roads still
worked the traffic lights still worked there was still electricity police still turned up firemen still turned up
because the men do the real work oh there was no HR department for four days
oh no what are we going to do about the gender equality diversity Department ah
turns out that just proved themselves wrong because if for four days all the
men didn't go to work society would crumble instantly and it's a shame that
it is the men which are so vital to society which are the ones which are permanently
demonized I was saying this the other day I was driving in my Ferrari sf90 104
with a beautiful woman and we're discussing feminism because sometimes when women hear crap from The Matrix
am I allowed to say this without going back to jail yeah probably not
women are either programmed by Society or programmed by the man there with that's what I believe I believe that
women have evolutionarily they've evolved to be
adaptable which is why women are cunning they can be very cunning women and I
think that in days of old if there were a member of a tribe and their tribe lost
to war and all their men were killed their only chance of survival was to adapt to the ways of the new tribe
pretty quickly they couldn't disagree with the new tribe because they can't defend themselves so they have to learn
to adapt and you can look through history to see how this has happened endless times and normally when an army
comes in it kills all the men and takes all the women as slaves and the women don't usually have to stay slaves if they're pretty good at their job they
can give a nice back rub and you know famose within three weeks they're a wife or something and it's fine so I think
that women are
are you think I'm going back to jail WR I'll not see you there yeah no but women
women are adaptable and cunning and I'll come back to that point later
let's move on I'll come back to it you need to get yourself in the comments right now and let me know what you
thought about that wild roller coaster make sure you listen to part two right now cuz it's even more wild the massive
rant to the entire crypto Community will blow you away get on part two right


attacking me new each day um but I guess that was built for it because it doesn't bother me like it
should perhaps you seem to be doing pretty well given the circumstances I know the truth of my heart and I know
that what I say is the truth and I understand very well the internet and how it works and I also think I'm perspicacious enough to understand
there's certainly a degree of weaponized virtue and perhaps a degree of jealousy and perhaps a few other things are
involved in all of these attacks I don't believe that people who sit and attack somebody for their past especially
something so long ago are genuinely virtuous I don't think it's about virtue I think it's about well I can get some
clicks this way or I can get some views that way or he did the biggest interview ever or whatever it is there's certainly
some other motivations and uh I don't want to say water off a duck's back I don't want to come across
as arrogant however I do believe that since the dawn of human time every single King with any
kind of empire was constantly at War and I think if you're going to become one of the most famous people on the internet you're going to be at War and you'd be a
fool to become massively influential and then cry about the fact that you end up in constant battles it doesn't matter if
you're Napoleon or Charlemagne or Genghis Khan there's always someone prodding the edges of your Empire trying
to find weakness see what a little bit of land they can take and I think it's always been the same and right now I
guess you could say I to a degree I certainly have an Empire and I'm massively influential and there's a degree of uh
I wouldn't say jealousy but there's certainly some ambitious people who are trying to damage it I think that's what it is so I did see a mashup clip that
we're not going to show because I I thought it was unfair I will say that um only because there was no context
provided to the clips it was just an extract of something that you said that 10 years ago some of them were
literally 10 years ago um didn't know what year it was from didn't know who you were talking to didn't know what context it was and I've
been victimized online by something like that before where somebody takes something abstract and says well this is
what must be what she means until they're provided the full context of the clip and I also take exception to I
think digging back 10 years um I don't know who could survive that litmus test I'm 34 years old today 10
years ago today I speak to my audience I talk about they call me puritanical I talk about you know not drinking I think
the biggest change has been becoming a mother and it would really be unfair if
we went and found Candace at 24 years old liberal dancing at one Oak and said well look at these clips of Candace
Owens fortunately I had no cameras in my face 10 years ago you somehow did
um so I think it's a bit unfair I also think that some of the critique that is coming your way is coming from people
who are well intentioned like they actually don't perceive maybe perhaps
okay this is 10 years ago what the context is has he changed since so I will ask the question and we are going to get into some of those clips who said
you're an open book how have you transformed and I I've seen changes just I think in the last five
years who are you today how have you transformed that's a very good question it's also very important when you talk about Candace from 10 years ago the idea
that you did something 10 years ago which you would no longer agree with is one thing but the second thing to I to come along to the conclusion that you
now have no value to add to the world would be massively unfair right everybody changes and that's fine I'm
not the kind of person who's going to sit and apologize for his past I believe all's well that ends well I believe we're humans and we grow and we learn
I'd be a fool and I'd be disingenuous to sit here and pretend I was sorry for something I did in the past and I'm not
going to do that I'm going to be very honest to everyone at home I've talked at length for a very long time about my
history and the fact I used to run a webcam business and I don't feel guilty for that I know that's maybe what they
want from me I don't feel sorry for that I've never hurt anybody it has nothing to do with my current criminal case everybody who worked for me was very
positive in fact my number one supporters currently online and my best lifelong friends and some of
the letters I got in jail were from people who worked for me at that time and I had a business and
I'm not going to sit here and try and pretend that I feel guilty or I feel sorry for that I'm from a low income
background I did what I had to do to survive and truthfully all in all
being very honest I don't think what I did was really that bad and I want to say that and I know people are going to
lose their minds for it but I didn't tell drugs I didn't kill anybody I mean what did I
do I I found a gap in the market and I helped some people organize some accounts on an internet website that's
what I did and they're going to try and criticize me and crucify me for the next 100 years because of it because of clips that were made 10 years ago I think it's
disingenuous and I don't think anyone actually really cares about the virtue of it because nobody Who's involved in my life back then is complaining about
anything I think it's just an attack on me and certainly we learn and we grow and we change but it's very interesting how
hypocritical the idea of looking at somebody's life over such a long period actually is I mean we can look at Donald
Trump right who I'm a fan of I guess you're I know you've had your ups and downs with him but in the conservative sphere he's pretty well respected Donald
Trump used to own the Miss Universe Pageant are we gonna criticize him are we going
to crucify him what about the girls he had in Miss Universe who decided to go on and do Playboy magazine is he a bad person now why that's not Christian
values right people are messy and life is messy and nothing is completely clean
and this idea that you're going to find somebody and 10 or 11 years ago they did something which might even be slightly
distasteful not even illegal and you're going to crucify him forever I just don't believe that's genuine
virtue I think it's just an attack I do think what's happening right now is they are wrongly conflating you having
run a webcam business however long it was ago to the criminal cases happening in Romania and this is why introduction
in my voice when people were saying he's not a conservative he's not a Christian I don't understand why Christians are giving him a platform and I'm very sorry
to interrupt I'm very sorry to interrupt you but yeah I will say right now I would never consider myself a conservative from that standpoint right
I'm a rat I'm a rational actor I'm a reasonable person I'm intelligent I use
my brain and I guess that makes me aligned with many conservative issues overall because the other side have lost
their minds I don't wake up and stand there as a conservative figure I don't consider myself a conservative figure I've just ended up aligning with them on
a lot of core issues because I'm a forward-thinking rational person but I'm certainly not a concern I don't stand up
and say hey I'm a conservative I don't I'm not interested in whether the conservative want to embrace me from
that perspective or not I have no interest in that I wasn't even particularly political until my recent
debacle where I realized a lot of things about the world and how avoiding politics will not save you unfortunately yeah that's and that's one of the things
I pointed out was I said he's never said he was conservative why are we he's he is not identifying as a Christian so why
are we suddenly using that as whether or not a Christian a conservative can put him on a platform and talk about something that is relevant and something
that is relevant is whether or not you are being wrongly or unfairly persecuted by a government
I have spoken on my platform after examining the charges against Harvey Weinstein he's clearly not a
conservative he's about as far left as it really gets but that doesn't mean that I don't have an interest in whether
or not he's guilty or not guilty and whether or not he was persecuted because of a overtly political movement like me
too so I I I do not like that these things are being conflated but I want to park by the side because we are going to
get into your case and just stick with what you just said about the webcam business so you say you don't have any guilt for it um I'm not sorry I don't
operate in that frame I don't think it's an intelligent way for a man to go through life to say I'm sorry at a
younger age I did the best I could possibly do and I did the best I believed at the time and you grow from it and you
learn and perhaps there's times in your life where you look back and think well maybe I would have done this differently because hindsight's always 20 20. but
every rapper sold drugs like you get to a certain stage in your career where you no longer sell drugs and you don't do it
anymore but that's part of the life journey and life's messy and I'm not going to sit here and apologize to any
conservative who wants to sit me down and try and give me some moral High Ground garbage I'm not gonna I'm not going to listen to it I had a very rough
upbringing a very tough life and it could have been so much worse in so many ways I've done nothing illegal I've
never hurt anybody everybody who was involved in my life back then are massive supporters of me and I think it's very hypocritical for someone to
sit look at a situation they were not involved in and don't understand look at old clips taken out of context and then
tell me and a whole bunch of people who were in my life who were all perfectly happy that something bad happened or something wrong happened I don't think
that's genuine and for that reason
I'm not going to sit and uh be preached to by these people who are imperfect themselves everybody's
imperfect and another thing that's really important we talk about Christian values I also think that I find it very
interesting and ironic that I'm somehow the problem and these Christians feel like they need to come and attack me now
in in the name of Christian values I think Christianity has much bigger problems than Andrew Tate in some old clips I think they have much bigger
problems that are happening in their churches on a daily I think you can go to a Christian church and a lot of America be very disappointed in what
you've seen I don't think I'm the problem with Christianity and yeah it's very interesting but there was
a webcam company and I've talked about it at length on many different podcasts I had a business many girls on there were perfectly fully clothed and would
paint pictures or sing and dance and laugh I've talked about this at length I've had nothing to do with it for 10 or 11 years and nobody was ever hurt
and I am not sorry for it I don't see why I should be okay so the way that I
read you and you can definitely let me know if I'm wrong obviously because you are you is that people that don't come
from a lot me and you obviously um obviously have different decisions that
lay before us in life than people that come from everything or people that come from a very stable household Two Loving
parents um and this kind of gets into dilemma I remember years ago Tommy Lauren had said
something she's a political commentator in the US had said something to the effect of well you know Jay-Z used to sell crack and he sort of laughs and he
probably did and he did and he sort of laughed this off and I remember looking at that because I
looked up to Jay-Z's music so much you know and I looked up to him because it made it possible for me to change my
circumstances and looking at this guy who comes from nothing he came from the projects he sold drugs and then he
doesn't have to sell drugs anymore and he's now talking about ideas and talking about business so I was able to more
closely understand and go okay I could actually climb out of these circumstances even though I didn't wasn't born you know with a ton of
wealth and a lot of opportunities that some like some people were and I think it's very difficult for people that don't come from nothing to understand
that and they're so sure that if they were in Desperate circumstances that they would still never do anything but
this is their massive mistake and you're right but this is their massive mistake the reason I have such huge Affinity with the Youth of the world today
especially the masculine youth is one because a lot of them are disenfranchised which is one conversation but two also the reason my
reach is so Global the reason I have so many fans in Slovenia and South Side Chicago and I've been I've had kids from
Ulan Batar come up to me Mongolia all around the world is because I speak to the disenfranchised and part of that is
always going to be or is going to involve financially disenfranchised I'm someone who comes from absolutely
nothing and made himself into something and unfortunately there's a rocky road sometimes like you just described with
Jay-Z to get that done but if I would have been born into a perfect family like you said two loving parents family
was rich white picket fence and I was saying all the same things then they wouldn't have the same Affinity so if
you look at even a lot of superheroes you look at Batman he's a flawed person and I think the reason I'm seen as a
hero and the reason I have the fan base I have is because to a degree I've always been a flawed person and I'm not
a perfect human and I don't want to be and I think that that actually adds a lot of credibility to my character as a
whole that I've become the kind of person who believes he can add value to the world and just like you said with
Jay-Z he changed and the biggest thing for me personally
though truthfully and I want the whole world to understand this I've been forensically analyzed by multiple
different federal agencies from different countries for the last 17 months analyzing every aspect of my
entire life across the last 10 to 15 years and what did they find an old YouTube clip that's the worst
they could find no sexual perversion no drugs no genuine criminal acts they
found something semi-immoral in a YouTube clip and I would actually challenge anybody who wants to throw
stones at me to go through the same level of scrutiny I have been under and let's see what they find in your life
because I guarantee anyone who's watching this right now you sit there you have a secret in your closet you have a skeleton that you don't want
anyone to know about and they would have found it so what's the worst thing that they found about me considering I've been the most attacked man in the world for 17 months now an outdated YouTube
clip and out of context YouTube is that the worst I think it's I think it's crazy that people aren't even sitting there and
going okay this guy's been absolutely attacked and from every single angle and this is the worst they could possibly drag up right so I agree with you so I
the question I would ask you though and because obviously you've moved away from that business you now the thing I find to be the most
interesting about you is that younger boys love you yes they absolutely like
the 12 13 year old 14 year old I I have not come across the top third chair and boy who's not just an Andrew Tate Stan
yeah and I think that's it's remarkable gives you a lot of power and I think this is perhaps the interest that a lot
of people have in you is what are you going to do with this power right you have all these boys they believe in you they stand up for you and that is why it
becomes important to state I'm not sorry that I lived this I don't think I would say that I'm sorry for
anything that I decisions that I made when I was young either because that this is the deck of hands that I was given what do you want me to do but at
the same time I do try to now knowing that I have such a following of a lot of young ladies that follow me say like
listen I did the idiot stuff so you don't have power power and responsibility go hand in hand and that's the thing that's so
interesting these out of date clips and they want to talk about these things from 10 years ago at the time when I was talking to camera those videos are made for private circulation initially
secondly I wasn't trying to educate the world anything back then I didn't have to kind of power and influence I have back then the way you say something to a
video which has 50 viewers has to be different than the way you say something to a video that's 50 million viewers
power and responsibility absolutely go together and I understand that very well and I understand the power I have and I
do believe I'm now an absolute Force for good in the world and I'm far more careful with how I'll project myself
with certain ideas absolutely agree completely but that's the thing that's even so crazy
about all of it these old videos Everyone's so concerned about wouldn't even circulate if my haters weren't constantly trying to use them against me
they'd be disappeared into the history of the internet I don't know where these things come from I don't know where they were found I don't know where they are
it's kind of crazy a lot of people are making all these constant attacks on me and
I don't watch a lot about to be honest with you Candice I don't watch all of it but a lot of the videos are so outdated the only reason they even exist now is
because my haters are so desperate trying to take me down they don't have any concern for them being seen because they wouldn't be circulating them
otherwise so yeah absolutely power and responsibility go hand in hand and I do believe that I now have a huge
platform and with young boys they're exceptionally interested in my case I do believe to a degree I'm an anti-hero
I do believe to a degree that the harder I'm attacked the more credibility is given to me in
the eyes of my fans I think that they see ah everyone's out to get this guy everyone was out to get Batman this kind
of feels that way and I do try and Lead everyone down a good path and say extremely positive things and I don't think anybody is
finding any clips from the last five to six years which have anything negative in them right I think you've changed that's why I say over the last five
years I think there's been there's been a seismic shift and speaking to boys the younger Boyd I think one of the things
that they're really suffering from I get tons of responses rather unexpectedly whenever I talk about the topic of pornography on my show and it's one of
those things that again if you found Candace 10 years ago and you asked me about pornography and by the way this was actually implanted into my head from
a health school like from health education where they would say pornography is healthy people should watch pornography people who should
engage in pornography it's okay if you're in a relationship for you to watch pornography and then I had a huge wake-up call when I spoke to Tim Ballard
you know he runs operation underground and then I realized how closely pornography is related to human sex
trafficking real sex trafficking not noticing trafficking and yeah we should talk about that because they are kind of
stretching the definition of sex trafficking in your case I've taken a look at it and what's remarkable to me is the
amount of young men and I would say from the ages of 18 to 35 that write in and
say how much they're struggling with porn how much they're struggling with pornography addiction um how they feel that no person is
talking about the ills of pornography and so I just watched this clip of you this morning sitting next to Adam 22.
you were ever interested in doing your first ever double penetration scene that me and Lena I mean I I don't want to
speak for you but I feel like Yo dude would he be a suitable candidate can I tap him in I don't know no
[Music] can I can I fill in real quick Andrew you know you're out Aiden we care for
you you're not in you're not in this conversation anymore fair enough go ahead Andrew would you would you would you Andrew would you double penetrator
bro would you answer questions together is that chill
there's absolutely zero percent chance of that happening and it's not because Elena is
particularly unattractive it's because she's married to Adam and I have no interest in degenerate pointless sex and
I have no interest in making a spectacle of myself or even just involving myself in anything
which I deem to be overall Haram and pointless that's just not something I'd be interested in
there's not there's not a single amount of money on the planet you could pay me to to undertake so you're very polite
I'm not going to be so polite I thought he was an absolute degenerate um and and I mean that the idea of
having a woman making the vows that you make in marriage and literally offering
her body as he did to you was a former generous State and you were being very nice and measured and I think that for
that moment that was the best thing that you possibly could have done because she looked quite vulnerable uh Lena I think
is her name but how do you reconcile that now right you're in a circumstance like this
you're being polite you did say I'm uncomfortable you did say that I would never do this I think if that was really important for you to say but you're not
the same person I mean how did you yeah even reflecting on it yes it's so disgusting he offered you his wife
it is pretty disgusting it's also pretty misogynistic because he didn't ask her he offered her
I felt sorry for her so I was very measured with my conversation with them because I felt sorry for her I could tell she was nervous she was swinging on
the chair back and forth she didn't want to be there she felt extremely nervous and I think that only a coward would
berate a very nervous very scared woman even if she did something which I personally disagree with even if I think
Adam is personally he doesn't align with my morals because she was so nervous and
because she was so almost afraid she looked and I think she expected me to go go at her hard so I just felt sorry
doing it I I just didn't I couldn't find maybe I'm getting soft in my old age but I thought
I think she knows what I think and I think she knows what the world thinks and I think if I go at her too hard it's
just gonna break her and I don't really like the idea of her you know turning off the camera and bawling her eyes out I think that God will teach her
the lessons she needs to learn from her experience both positive and negative and I think that's God's job to do and not necessarily mine
but yeah it was certainly uncomfortable and it shows how degenerate the world is becoming and
pornography as a whole is simply just I think a I think it's an effect I think it's a tool which is used to ensure that the
male popular stays as docile as possible I don't think that any of the things that are happening to the male population are
accidental I think that keeping us as docile as possible is very interesting for the people who are in charge of the
world because we're the warrior class at the end of the day it's going to boil down to the men who are going to stand
up and actually do something about anything at some point at some point in time so I think they like the idea of us being docile and I mean how much more
docile can you get than a man staring sitting there looking at a screen not even want to reproduce for real because he's just staring at a screen and I
think that's just the next stage in the slave mind and it's everywhere now whereas and this is something that my
husband says he doesn't have any social media he's like Instagram is pornography I open my Instagram and I've got Emily
rajkowski's butt cheeks and I'm not a man so I don't have that same biological reaction to seeing it but I can only
imagine how difficult it is for a man when you open an app and you've got Kim Kardashian offering her body too Emily
rajkowski even if you're walking down the street I've realized even how desensitized I've become to pornography
because you see an ad for Gucci and for whatever reason she's got to be completely naked while she's holding the bag I remember in my lifetime I remember
in my lifetime there were music videos that got censored or banned or only be played after 10 or 11 at night and if
you watch them now you'd be like what for what what is that a bikini like it's nothing it's amazing how quickly it has
degenerated and yeah absolutely and we're all degenerating with it like I've realized the fact that I don't have a
reaction to seeing the half-naked woman holding a Gucci bag means that I have been desensitized to pornography and I
can only imagine what that does to men oh completely and it's it's but this is what the powers that be want they want
to make sure that the male populace is as docile as possible and they do that with a large array of weapons and they do that with a web of tools and I
believe that I'm the counter to that which is the reason I ended up attacked in the first place but unfortunately when you buy into the slave man mind
programming you not become the kind of man who can easily attract a woman because you're not attractive to females
as a whole so how do you satisfy yourself you end up sitting there staring at a screen and they convince you that's a good life to live as a man
and that's perfectly fine and perfectly normal and you don't even get to genetically reproduce I do also though and I want to make this
clear I do believe an absolutely not our self-accountability as a man I think is a man everything that happens to you is
your fault me going to jail was my fault me being attacked online was my fault if all these bad things that happened to me
I will take responsibility for even if I believe they were unfair or unjust and I think that any man who's going to sit
there and say I'm struggling I'm struggling he also needs to wake up and understand that if you're going to truly struggle to not click on a website then
you're going to deserve the terrible life you're going to live and the devil or the Matrix or wherever you want to
call them are going to fill your life with Temptations they're going to fill your life with Easy Way outs that they're going to want you to take
because the good road is usually the hardest Road they're going to continue to fall for them then you're going to have to suffer the consequences of that
so it's it's it's double-edged it's certainly difficult that pornography is everywhere and men are
struggling with it but to me what's even more upsetting is that these men don't have enough fortitude and enough mental
strength to wake up and say I'm better than that but but this is this is the thing right so I'm about to get started
10 days this is the thing but it's the thing right so when you attack a man's mental fortitude on one
issue you attack on all issues this is why it's done purposefully to resist a slave mind you need to be able to resist
in the first place how can you resist a slave mind if you have no physicality you have no willpower no ability to mentally resist anything well then what
you're gonna end up doing you'll end up eating the bugs and watching the porn and sitting in front of your computer and that's what they want from from the people so I think that it's actually all
very interconnected people come at me with the porn problem and I get the same thing guys say to me
all the time hey what are you gonna do what should I do I struggle with pornography and I say that's because you have nothing else in your life in order
if you were in good physical condition and you had the money you were supposed to have and you had the mentality you
were supposed to have you wouldn't need it so the reason you're so addicted to porn is because everything else in your life is a failure
and yeah it's certainly a complicated issue it's a difficult one and this is why they fear male agencies so much because
when men truly wake up and decide to be the best versions of themselves they're hard to control because all these control mechanisms Fall by the wayside
they don't want the porn anymore they don't want the antidepressants anymore they don't want the garbage anymore and now you have a whole bunch of men who
actually want truth and honor and respect and they want to live for something and then what are they going to live for they're going to want to be
brave they're going to want to do the right thing regardless of how dangerous it may be for their own personal circumstance and that sounds like a
difficult population to enslave I mean that's that's what's scary how do you reconcile first off how long
ago was your webcam business yeah so I stopped I stopped having any involvement with it I think eight to nine years ago
I stopped it was a long time ago it was at the early stages of the internet and I'll explain it one more time for people I've explained it already at
lines but I'll explain it from the beginning I had a company I was fighting at the time
and on a side note I actually want to make this clear we talk about things people have done in the past for money I beat I beat people up for money
I hurt people for money I don't often tell people this and I think this first interview I've mentioned in there's a person who can never walk the same again
because he fought me I've had 87 professional flights and I did my best to kill people you're going to sit here and talk about what I did for money I
literally hurt people for money and so I'm a perfect person I'm not sorry for my kickboxing career or my cage fights
I'm sorry for anybody I had bare knuckle fights I'm sorry for any of them right I was a person who had to pay the bills I
lived the Life I Lived I used the tools I had and I ended up opening a webcam
company where girls would sit on a laptop and they would talk to guys on the internet for money that's what they
would do the girls would sit there fully clothed or a bikini some of them would paint pictures some of them would sing songs it's very similar to Twitches now
twitch is almost more sexual than the sexual websites were back then I helped the girls set up accounts we worked
together I helped them become as popular as possible and everybody made money and everybody was happy and nobody is
complaining about it nobody's upset about it none of the girls have worked for me are upset about it the government aren't after me for it it's perfectly
legal nothing's wrong with it there's just a whole bunch of people who now think that they can take the moral High Ground against me because I previously
ran this company and I think I can anticipate the question you're going to ask how do I reconcile with the fact
that I used to produce pornography or degree pornographic
content writing to you like how do I and now men are trying to escape it yeah that's a really good question there's a
few different ways I can answer that question I think the first way I'll answer it is if you own a liquor store
and an alcoholic comes in and you refuse to sell him alcohol does he stop being an alcoholic no he just goes and buys
from someone else so that's the co that's the cop-out answer the cop-out is well they were all these people who were addicted are always going to be addicted
regardless of whether I did it or not so that's the cop-out answer but the second answer I can give which I
think is more detailed and probably more nuanced is one I intimately understand the
relationship between men and these websites I've had and seen men give away their life savings to girls they've
never met I've watched and I've seen it and I actually think a lot of the insights I give a lot of the things I
tell the world about the male men Mental Health crisis about men being so constantly lonely about how important it
is to build yourself into a high value man about how money alone is not enough I explain all these things a lot of
these are lessons from the webcam days I saw dudes who had a whole bunch of money no other attributes and ended up on
these websites spending hundreds of thousands of dollars because they didn't have anything else so I think I learned
a lot of important life lessons and I do my best to try and pass them on to people but I guess also and this is the final
answer I want to give about this whole subject is that I do think I can take
the question you're asking and reverse engineer it and use it against the people who are trying to attack me for it my my answer to it would be how do
you sit and want to criticize me for being involved in the production of
pornography 10 or 11 years ago if you're involved in the consumption of it because you're creating a market for it
so anybody who wants to sit and say that I did things wrong that's fine you're allowed to throw stones but if you're in a glass house if you have ever signed up
to an only fans account if you have Instagram if you're following these models on Instagram who you don't know who are showing their tits and ass all
day if you've watched porn if you fancy so or stick some beautiful woman on a movie if you're going to live in lust
yourself and you're funding this entire industry you're Downstream you're at the bottom of it how can you then take the
moral High Ground on the person who's producing it that doesn't make sense to me so if you've totally abstained from pornography your entire life and you've
never looked at it ever and you've never been involved with it ever and you're a perfect person and you want to come along and say what I did was wrong that's fine but I don't think most
people are complaining can even say that I don't think they can and I now will once again State this and I'll State
this as a matter of almost fact the level of Investigation I have gone under the level of forensic investigation my
life has been submitted to most people don't understand most people have never been through what I've been through they've not had their entire life
forensically analyzed every word they've ever said everyone they've ever spoken do every WhatsApp chat everything head
to toe by federal agencies for the last 10 years and the most they come up with is that I ran a webcam company which
I've already admitted to that's it take these people who criticize me and see how many porn websites they've been on
get their laptops see they've Googled see who they've spoken to look it's it's
all massively hypocritical I do understand that some people would hear that and go oh you know he's a bad
person Etc I don't think I was a bad person I never hurt anybody I think I could have done much worse things I know many people from my circumstances who
did many things worse than what I did and all in all I'm not going to sit and pretend I'm sorry for something I'm not
sorry for and I I just want to make it clear to the world that like you said people come from different
backgrounds and and people grow and people change Etc but I also look at the world in a different way I think that we're all constantly doing our best
I think I'm doing the best I can right now when I'm 55 I might watch this interview and think I'm an idiot right
and I think we're all constantly doing our best and I did the best I could do at the time and I don't think it makes
sense for me to hate past me for doing his best I just don't think that's a very constructive mindset living a
healthy lifestyle can be challenging when you're always on the go you need simple manageable routines to make sure that you're getting the proper nutrition

Candace yeah I think it's really important for conservatives who identify and say I'm a conservative to recognize
that the people it's not people that are perfect that are bringing people over to our side I
was not brought over to conservative principles by people preaching at me and telling me how perfect their lives were it was actually people that were much
more broken that led me here it's which is fascinating I got interested in business because of Jay-Z yeah I criticized him all the time now about
things that he does but you're not I'm not interested you know and Kanye West you know him doing a Christian album and
things of that nature it you need people that are flawed you need people that are
real this is the thing I'm not particularly political I didn't consider myself particularly political
but it looks like I'm kind of ending up there and like I said I'm a realist which puts me on the conservative side and I'm not stupid and I understand very
well about the world and propaganda and what they're trying to do to us so you end up being conservative by default but you're a real person if you have flaws
if you want to sit and tell a dis a disadvantaged youth growing up in the
south side of Chicago what how he's supposed to live his life from your perfectly manicured garden and
your white picket fence you're not going to get through to that person they don't care what you have to say actually becomes a bit of a turn off absolutely
and those were things on me that I don't think will ever change which is why I get your following I get what people
like about you it's why you say the disenfranchised follow you and I think it's important for people to understand that like there was no way like and I
still have no respect for her at all but it's why I snapped so hard at like the Meghan McCain's I'm like who the hell
are you what have you done in your life that you think I'm going to take advice what you've just been someone's daughter
right what have you worked for absolutely what have you survived tell me something that you lived through in
your life that was a struggle you can't yeah because your life has been perfect and so I think it's it's so foolish to
think that I'm gonna take a lesson in me that I'm more likely to take a lesson from a Megan McCain why I don't even think is a conservative I think she's
just a rich girl and got rich in way worse ways and you got rich what was Daddy doing overseas yeah um that's a
really amazing point because we can also look at that right conservatives will sit here and attack me we can that there are people who are making millions from
blowing children to pieces like let's let's get the world in perspective here first oh but it's cleaners they didn't
get their hands they didn't get their hands dirty of course yeah I totally agree with you and and that's why I am
never the first to bark uh when someone is suddenly assessing someone's entire life I'm like look at your entire you
are literally built on the backs of dead Iranian children absolutely and and I'm standing up here also and I want to make
this very clear like I've not tried to avoid this judicial process I've not tried to run away from anything I'm
standing here saying if I've committed a crime put me in jail and if I haven't committed a crime the what can you say I've done I'm perhaps could you could
argue it was slightly immoral perhaps but I also to degree maybe I'm a Libertarian I think of 20 people or 30
people get in a room and they all agree to do something and it makes them happy then they should be allowed to do it if nobody's hurt nobody's upset by it then
they should do it and perhaps that does make your Liberty libertarian if 30 full-grown men decide to go into a room
and be gay and they want to be gay then they should be allowed to go be gay or Thirty men you're not hurting anybody is what you want to do do you want to wear
red t-shirts wear red T-shirts if me and my brother had 30 people we all got together they wanted my money and everyone was happy who's others to come
along criticize and say people are victims people are upset this is wrong this is bad Etc so yeah you're completely right it's
amazing how people throw stones and how imperfect everybody is truly and I think the best thing you can do as a man is
obviously learn your lessons from your life and try your best to pass them on I feel like I'm doing that to the best of my ability but also
another thing that conservatives is going to blow their minds is going to really upset them what they don't understand about especially the strength
of my message is that too especially the young boys of the world I'm cool I'm cool and and I know they think that
doesn't matter but if you want to sit behind a desk and go da da da the Republican bill 304. nobody you're a
dork so no one gives right you're a nerd I go to big cars and pretty women and I
live the lifestyle if you want to really capture the Youth of today you need to get some kind of affinity with them they
need to at least want to be you to a degree you need to at least be their hero to a degree this is where liberalism wins I don't think a lot of
conservatives understand that liberalism's sexy you do drugs you run around you burn stuff it's cool you get
a par a because what a conservatives do stay home stay home stay it's boring right at least what they don't
understand is that conservatives will sit there and go he's a terrible role model because he has all these pretty girls in this fast car and he's a
materialistic that's the only that's the reason I can actually help the world that's the reason young boys will listen
to me you said it yourself 14 15 year old boys they'll look at my life and go okay I want to listen to this guy they
don't want to listen to me if I sit behind a desk and read Republican bill 308. I don't read that crap I don't know and they don't care I agree with you I
mean I think one of the criticisms that I faced was that I care too much about culture on my podcast my culture is interesting culture is what is changing
minds and changing Hearts because we don't want to compete with liberals in the cultural space and what are we doing this for a hundreds what do you think
the young kids do you really think that they're like you said following a Senate bill but just hit the desk or do you think that how you convey that to them
and how you're talking about ideas actually matters and culture matters and it's something that conservatives gave
up um many years ago and they wonder why they lose and then we call it Compass cultural Trump was cultural Trump was
fake news yeah he was Trump was a hero and to be a hero you have to be attacked
and you have to be an imperfect person and and that's the reality of the world and culture is super important and you're right in regards to conservatives
giving up I I'm trying to think of conservative culture now I mean I like to think that we're making
degeneracy unpopular I like to think that there are some good voices out there that is making God cool again I
actually like to believe the pendulum is swinging I do believe it and I see it online and it's a combination of so many
small things coming together almost in perfect timing but it is cultural you need a cultural shift that moves away
from this insanity and you're right if you just want to sit there and just preach nobody's going to be interested
in it and I also think that especially in the masculine realm I can't talk for being a woman but I can talk for being a
man in the masculine realm we certainly like to see people lead by absolute in our example because traditionally we
would be following our commander or the man we respected into war so we'd like to know he can at least fight you'd like
to see he's at least Brave you like to see him lead by example and I think especially if conservatives want to win
the culture War then they need to lead by example if you're going to if you're going to be a conservative preacher and you want to tell men about
how they should live their lives you should be as strong as possible you should look in shape you should be big you should show You're motivated you're
disciplined you should you should absolutely of course you we all have vices but you should be very
disciplined with your outlook and you make it very clear to the outside world that what you've done wrong what you haven't done wrong you should take accountability I think you need to lead
by example I don't think you can preach to men I don't think you can preach to young boys I think that's the reason why they don't do so well in school in
general I don't think that's the reason why they're disenfranchised I think you need to just lead by example and let them follow and I feel like I'm kind of
doing that by just live by just standing up and saying No this is who I am and I'm Unapologetic for it and this is what
I've done and this is what I intend on doing and I try and I'm going to try and save the world so I want to shift gears here and talk
about your dad because I'm quite fascinated by your dad he passed recently yeah how many years ago uh nine
I think nine years nine years ago but wow just wasn't all I was expecting a chess champ serve the country
um his name was Emery really interesting to talk about just I guess your upbringing with him as this chess champ
how did he get into chess yeah my I do believe I had the best father on the planet
a lot of the things I regurgitate are regurgitated from him a lot of the things I say he literally said to me
line for line I believe that he was very
morbid in his approach to life and he wanted me to understand that he will not be here forever and he wanted
me to understand that when he was gone I had a duty to fulfill he talked about dying a lot
which I guess is kind of unusual but he would even though he was relatively young he died when he was 58.
but he was a chess yeah he was a chess professional he was a professional chess player he was one of the best chess players in the world and
he what's most interesting about him is he almost predicted the future absolutely and utterly perfectly he was talking about the Ukraine Russia War
back in 2013 and he was talking about how the gay children gay people can't have children so they're going to come
for your children trust me that's what they're going to do the children are next like he would say all these things back like 10 or 11 years ago and I'd be
like all right Dad you're a bit crazy calm down but uh I guess when you're a chess player you see the future and he raised me with absolute accountability
and he certainly raised me and Tristan to be he understood what the world expects of men and he raised us to be strong and
even when we were in jail my mother would call I'd speak to her on the phone and she'd say how are you doing and I'd say oh don't worry she would say yeah
Dad raised you for this like we were always raised to be Warriors so I don't think I could have possibly ever
had a better father I I'm gonna miss him forever and I think the best thing I can do is be the best version of myself to
give honor and respect to him and I think that's the best where did he pick up chess it's quite unusual he's American he was
American black American I don't know too many black American chess players full stop
um where did he pick up chess he taught himself and he taught himself and he just read a couple books I think he read three chess books and ended up being one
of the best players in the world and incredible it's incredible but it's actually interesting when you talk about we were just discussing an affinity and
how people are imperfect people and how it allows you to actually teach things better my father towards the end of his
chess career especially made most of his money teaching chess in inner city schools because he's a big black guy so
the children would be like ah okay I'll listen to this man you're right so it's amazing how Affinity is real and coming
from a certain socioeconomic background is real and you know we all talk about how ridiculous racism is but also to a
degree pattern recognition is real I look like him I can be like him these things are real so yeah he he did
fantastically well in terms of teaching especially disadvantaged children and uh he taught himself and I wish I
had his mind I'm not nearly as intelligent as he was I wish I was real smart to be a good chess player you've got to be better than smart I actually
think you go beyond the realm of smart into a I wouldn't say he was on the Spectrum
but you certainly get to a new level of social interactions do you understand I'd go to chess tournaments when I was a
kid and everybody there would be a World level chess player and everyone was a bit strange a little bit um I don't know if it's like that
anymore I see the chess communities now moved online there's a lot of them playing online they seem a lot more normal than the Grandmasters I
remembered I remember an old Grandmasters half drunk xkgb shaking at the board yeah like it was a bit
different back then but um yeah I wish I had his level of intellect he was certainly the smartest person I've ever known and even when he died I got
endless emails from people I'd never heard of who just said I worked with your dad and I don't think you understand how smart he was he served
America yeah served America he was in the Air Force and he was a linguist for the CIA he joined the Air Force he ended up being a linguist for the intelligence
what other languages did he speak he spoke Russian German Spanish and English but officially he was supposed to speak Russian he learned he assimilated
Russian in two weeks I think he holds the Air Force record okay so he's very smart yeah super ridiculously smart yeah
I got an email from somebody when he died and they said that that I just want to send you an email you don't know who I am I was serving with
your father in the armed forces I don't you tell everybody your dad was smart and they're not going to understand how
smart he was and I want to give you a quick story I was living with a Russian woman and I already spoke Russian conversationally when I began the Air
Force training to learn Russian your father knew nothing didn't know the alphabet didn't know nothing and within two and a half weeks he was correcting
everybody including the professor on Russian yeah so like he just read the dictionary I saw my dad sit there and read a dictionary just read it and that
was it it's like photographic memory like I'm a spectrum or something else going on yeah something with a little
X-Men Emery Tate was his name and everyone called him E.T he was tough on you he was certainly tough on me and I I
can't I can't express enough how grateful I am for that I we live in a world now where
I'm going to say that my dad hit me when I made a mistake and everyone's going to lose their minds and they're going to pretend I was somehow abused and that
somehow my childhood was terrible and I could not thank if he was come down to Earth today I would shake his hand and
say thank you for absolutely everything you gave me including discipline including understand that understanding
that in the harsh realities of the real world there is a line and if you cross that line violence appears that's the
unfortunate reality of Earth there's a line and if you cross it violence will appear either from a cop
or from a guy on the street or from someone you don't like or even a friend will turn on you whatever there's a line
that shouldn't be crossed and I learned that from a very young age and I'm very thankful for that I'm not sitting there saying a kid should be abused there's a
difference between abuse and discipline of course everyone with a brain understands that but he was extremely tough on me and if I could change
anything about my childhood I'd only wish it was tougher because life's tough life's hard and
I think that the best thing you can possibly do as a man is prepare for the endless difficulty that's going to come
your way there's no there's no way out as a man you're either going to have a very difficult life to become somebody important or you're going to suffer the
difficulty difficulty of being invisible what do you want to do you want to be invisible and just hide and work in
Starbucks and never have a girlfriend who truly loves you and nobody care if you live or die or do you want to go out there and be top G and be the most
famous man in the world and have government agencies trying to lock you up for no reason putting you in a dungeon you have to make a choice it's
going to be difficult either way so I think if you have a son and you're not preparing him for absolute difficulty
you're doing him a disservice I think that's what has to happen as a man and it's I've said this many times before
but I'm going to say it again I don't think many people understand exactly how competitive the masculine world is men
are constantly in competition with each other we always have been we used to go to war and fight and kill each other I guess in some places we still do maybe
that's calmed down a little bit but in the masculine world of today everybody is constantly competing for
everything the car that you want other people want the woman you want other people want the house you want other people want you're competing to have all
of it and how do you do that you do that through status and money and influence and power it's War I don't think many
women realize that when two men even meet each other for the first time it's like an unspoken maybe tiny bit at
the back of the mind there's a tiny analysis of could I fight this man yes
that's real real you go up and say hello hello um
within a one punch issue that's it oh he's one punch he's one punch he's three or four that's the reality of the
masculine world because we've evolved if you believe in evolution but I
my My Views are mixed but we've evolved to be in this position where we're constantly
analyzing possible threats and we're constantly analyzing people who perhaps are on our team or snakes Etc and I
think that not many people understand exactly how brutally competitive the masculine world is and I think the worst thing you can do for a son is just to
raise him in a bubble I my dad I'll say here people are losing Minds my dad used
to just randomly push me over I'd be like free just not hard but just
up boy okay Mom would be like why are you doing that son he's like you get pushed over that's life my Mom hated
that she did that to me but uh yeah I can give him nothing but praise I I'm really so thankful I had the the
upbringing I had do you think he's proud of you I'm certain he's proud of me and it's amazing how much strength I can get from
that it's amazing how much strength you can get from knowing that your ancestors looking down on you and you're doing your absolute best
I also believe that God can be proud of you when you do your absolute best and I don't think many people genuinely do
their best in the world anymore when I say do your best people sit and go oh yeah okay no when's the last time you
actually did your best like I don't train to run marathons but I know if I
gave my best I could run a marathon right now first try if I gave my best life depending on it when's the last
time people have genuinely given their best to anything there are people going through the world and going through life today that don't give their best or 100
effort to anything ever ever they can't remember the last time they tried so when I'm sitting in a dungeon I'm
sitting in a Romanian jail cell I understand that it is a chance that God has given me and my ancestors are watching for me to do my absolute best
and to show to them that I am the man I say I am you can't become the most famous man in the world for mental
resilience and God not test your mental resilience I think that would be a very amateur way to view the world that you
can now become one of the most famous men in the world who talks about mental discipline and mental resilience and God's not going to test it I think God's
going to come along and say okay you want to be Mr famous all right let's see what you have so I believed it was a a
chance to show God and show my ancestors and show my father that I am the man I say I am and it's amazing about strength
you can draw from that because I don't think many men especially understand that even if you don't have the strength
to be a hero for yourself you should have enough discipline and enough honor to want to be a hero for somebody else
and if you have other people you truly respect you should want to be a hero for them and I think that's the masculine
imperative if someone's going to attack your wife that's when you become a hero for her you have to what kind of man are
you if you're not and you can apply that to other things if you apply that to your ancestors you apply that to God or you apply that to your beliefs or your
core principles as a man then you can be a hero anytime you want so it's so funny that you say that because it really does
it goes everything goes back to biology I think about this all the time no matter how much sociology is behind everything telling men to act like women
and women to act like men at the end of the day women want a masculine man and when they don't have a masculine man and
they've beat their men into submission they're not attracting them anymore there's a tale in between it's just not attractive anymore and I made me think
of this boyfriend that I had when you were talking about you know just defending the realm the sort of responsibility that men have and I
remember sitting there realizing that I had to break up with him because I thought that if somebody burst through the door with a gun I was gonna have to
be the one that would have to defend us because he was just such a flower 100 and it's in society is yet blaring at
men to do the opposite and well they're trying to confuse us this is why I think think you have a platform this is my
whole theory that I built in my head about why you have a platform is because Lena Dunham Lena Dunham came before you
right and I think that for years men were told to act like sissies men were
told to put your tail between your legs that was the message the agreed upon message that came with you know Hillary
Clinton running the me too all of these things remember basically told that if you have a masculine Instinct you're
guilty and then inevitably because there is an equilibrium in this world because
there was landed onions because there was a Taylor Swift because there was the girl squads eventually what would have
to happen was that it was going to have to be evened out by someone saying no F that be a man yeah and I don't feel guilty for being a man and I don't think
any man should no and I think so either and I don't think and I think that the most annoying thing about all of
this is just how genuinely hypocritical it is because it's all this feminine movement and we don't need men and men
don't matter Etc that's only too many the whole it's a it's a agreed upon
message that men suck absolutely and it's only in the most favorable possible circumstances where females will say
that and that's what's so disingenuous about it because as soon as things actually begin to get hard the closer we
get to the realities of Life the closer we get to the unfortunate circumstances of the world and they exist in many places the faster you'll see people look
for traditional masculinity to protect them so it's not even like it's a genuine belief that's what's so upsetting about it is that it's just I
don't know if these people are delusional or if they're deliberately hypocritical I'm not sure which one it is I think they're brainwashed I think
it's it's a two-prong approach I think it's it's the cultural messaging and also in the education system they're
actively learning that this feminism is what you need to Aspire towards like when you get out of school women you
should want to compete with men in climbing the corporate ladder I actually think there there's a mass brainwash
that's taking place completely they want a newer men and the way to do that is to empower women to a point where they're now the dominant power especially in the
Western World I believe we live in a matriarchy I don't believe it's a patriarchy like we're told it is I actually believe it's the other way
around I can't think of a single law that benefits men over women but I can certainly think of some that benefit women over men I think it's very
dangerous to be a man in the world today I think that if women want to destroy a man it's extremely easy to do we can
look at my current scenario and situation I'm in and many other men are in the same scenario I can't think of many examples of a man
falsely accusing a woman of something and her losing her entire life where I can certainly think of one's the other
way around so yeah they want to turn men into eunuchs because their intention is
to make us all slaves and I say that and people I it rolls off my tongue and people just hear it they don't actually
think about what I'm saying their intention is to turn men into eunuchs because they want to make us all slaves I want you to actually understand
exactly what I'm saying to you because at the bottom line of revolution has always been young military age males and
they don't want them to have enough balls or enough Forward Thinking or even enough care for anything outside of themselves to do something about it
another thing people don't understand is that a lot of these attacks and a lot of things they're trying to do with the
culture especially they're trying to inject such innate selfishness inside of people that they don't really care about
anything that happens outside of themselves because then it's very difficult to give about your community it's very difficult to have any kind of
genuine care about your town or your country or an issue no they just want you to be self-absorbed semi-depressed
because depressed people don't fight that hard watching porn living inside of your own mind convinced that somehow
you're oppressed for some reason on the internet typing tweets that's what they want you to do and they're going to try
and keep you there and genuine masculinity yeah to a degree it's protective and to a degree also it has
parameters you you can't be a man who doesn't say no you can't be a man who doesn't have standards for himself and
for people around him I'm got labeled as ultra-misogynistic because I believe that a man should have standards in his
relationship I believe a man should avoid dishonest people male and female you should avoid if you're a dishonest
person if you lie if you're going to deceive me it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman I don't have anything to do with you I was sitting and talking on
a panel show saying that women who are dishonest and promiscuous are not the kind of woman I'd ever want to associate with and I was labeled misogynistic for
that so it's it's crazy how they'll attack you and they'll attack you so violently and so endlessly and repeat it
so many times in a in a bid to beat your soul down that's what they want
especially from me I truly believe I'm the number one prize for them to get if they can get me to just give up if we
can get Andrew Tate to just give up being a man's Bad come on Andrew say it and it's like
it's it's it's it's dangerous one thing but it's actually genuinely also sad when I analyze the situation in the
world we're in today I partly feel sad that we've ended up in this place where the people who are in charge are so evil and their plans are so so heinous and
the consequence is so dire that they know they can only Implement them if they genuinely remove the warrior Spirit from every man on the planet yeah it's
kind of sad and the warrior spirit is really important and it's something that I speak about a lot that men need to go
be men even in passive my marriage my husband needs his guide time it's I need
my girl time um the masculine effeminine it's very important the fact that my husband hunts and shoots and does these things that's
very attractive to me to know that if all of the grocery stores faded away that you could go catch dinner absolutely he knows how to skin an
animal and they poison that look at the hunters look at the way they view Hunters they look at people in the South this is why they know how to Ranch they
know how to farm they know how to to survive on their own which is why they start to poison that mentality which is why I think it's really important that
you're speaking to young men about why it is okay okay to be a man giving them permission to be a man in a capacity
that I can't give them that permission uh the same way that I try to give women the position to know that don't allow them to delude you to believing that
this is femininity it is not femininity Lena to have your husband offer your body to another man on camera that's the
poisoning they they teach women that this is sexual Freedom if this is sexual Liberation I looked at that and I saw a
slave relationship I saw a master offering his slave to
another person because he was just so I just love Andrew Tate would you would you like to see with my wife I would be
okay with that that is horrific that is not femininity that is not masculinity correct I absolutely agree with you on
that point you're totally right there and uh I think that's probably one of the most misogynistic things that have happened on the internet in recent times
but perhaps are on the right side of the political Spectrum I don't know I don't know which side they're on but if they're on the correct side you seem to get away with things as you all know

Candace hello the number one Christian prayer rap in the United States but um it's very interesting what you're saying
about your husband and fishing and hunting and stuff I completely agree with you and there's another thing about masculinity as a whole that I don't
think that a lot of people want to address but it's something that's certainly large in terms of my following because if we break down if anyone's
watching this now and they're trying to understand why is Andrew Tate so popular well I believe I have I speak to the base instincts of face instincts face
instance and one of the base instincts also for men I don't think a lot of people understand is to a degree is is peacocking and showing off to a degree
and I do that fantastically but um it is and if you look at men of old and they
used to conquer and they'd wear a feather from the man they killed or a piece of gold they stole there was
always that degree of flexing showing off and I think it's being unapologetically masculine saying yeah
I'm a big successful man and I can afford all this stuff and this is who I am and I've worked my ass off and this is what I have and I'm not sorry about
it and I've I'm dedicated and I'm hard working and no I'm not I don't feel like I should have to cower or hide or
apologize to the world for any of these things and I think that's the reason why a lot of men find Affinity in my message and
you're right Baseline masculinity is being attacked and women women naturally don't find it
attractive to find a man who's not that way anyway but Baseline masculinity is being attacked because they want you absolutely not only dependent on the
government so that the government can decide whether you eat that day and I don't want to be a pessimist but I still
think in many ways almost with technological advances it's going to be very difficult to resist I think it's actually scary I don't know how the
world's going to be in 100 years from now but I don't know if there's going to be much Freedom left I don't know I don't know about you but I when I look
at the things they're doing with cbdc's and electric cars and the way the currency is going to change it's going
to be very difficult to resist without literally starving to death so I don't know what's going to come so learn to
farm learn to farm that's right let them convince you that's somehow racist and sexist and backwards and veganism like
you better learn to do all those things because we need men now more than ever right and also I do believe and this is
going to get me called misogynistic but I'm going to say anyway I do believe we need masculinity especially in the households because I believe that women
are more emotionally LED and men are more logically LED it's true and I think that the propaganda machine and the News
machine primarily uses emotional arguments as opposed to logical arguments and women fall for them and women fall for the emotional arguments
so if you have a woman who's in charge of the household and her man can't resist her uh commands and they put on
the news be afraid be afraid covet's gonna kill everybody she gets afraid now you have a whole household of people
with masks on eight vaccines and down the insanity hole whereas a man with logic would sit there and do exactly
what I did and said look all right let's calm down for two minutes let's just let's just wait because the News lies so
let's just wait till Wednesday before we start taking injections it's chill so I think also masculinity is needed
because what they're going to do when they try and make us all slaves they're going to use emotional arguments and they're going to come along with I was
talking about Kobe with someone the other day and we're saying how insane it all was and I said imagine how insane something like covid will be once the
police force are robotic well imagine once it's all AI no mask done like at
least in certain countries and I know because I traveled the entire world doing covet I'll say here Republican then I broke every single coveted rule I
broke every single lockdown restriction I broke all of them every single one never listened anymore I broke more it's a competition yeah if it's a competition
I broke from day one I was like absolutely not I didn't even let people that were wearing masks into my house I
was like my baby will not look up and see somebody wearing a mask in his crib that's scary yeah looking like Bane look
over it like that's just not happening amazing but um yeah I mean we me and my brother we
moved to Sweden we resist A coping from the absolute beginning we tried our best because Sweden was completely wide open absolute insanity but yeah even to the
covet thing if you look at it the emotional argument that was used and how they controlled the world and they're going to use emotional arguments to
control us with everything I talk about the police force being AI what they're going to eventually do is say cops shoot people humans make mistakes cops are
racist we're going to give you robot cops that never make mistakes because cops are racist and cops can make
mistakes but these robots never make mistakes ever and then once all the police force are completely robotic and they've removed all our weapons you
think something like covet 2.0 isn't coming you think you're not gonna be locked in your house you think they're just gonna let you live in peace and
walk around outside are you an idiot and they're going to do all this with emotional arguments so that's why they want a matriarchy absolutely because
with a matriarchy you can affect it with emotionality you can sit there and say the planet is dying don't you care about
the trees give us all your money and people will sit there and go oh yeah I do feel bad about the planet okay it's
just an extra 18 tax and they can fall for it so emotional arguments are how
you get your way with anything if you give me somebody if you put somebody in front of me I can convince with an
emotional argument I convince of almost anything almost anything logic is much harder to do so we we need masculinity
even in the household and I'm not I'm just talking about Baseline masculinity of just the logic and the Rocks The Rock
Solid self-assurance to sit there and say no I'm in charge of this house let's all just calm down let's not get emotionally led by this news channel and
let's be very smart about what we do and how we react to things and that's why it's under attack and I think I talk about revolutions and I talk
about men being the military age males who are going to eventually stand up et cetera but I'm not be doomsdays about
anything I don't get arrested for any accusations but even just having a masculine Essence in a household makes
the whole household harder to Psy up I truly believe that and I can just think of covid when I use it as an example
because it's the most recent large psyop they've attempted on us where the amount of people I saved personally I must have
saved 200 people's lives from That vaccine me personally just because me as a man they'd come to me and go you know
I want to travel and say listen I don't have time to explain to you but have I ever been wrong no don't get it
okay a year later they're like I'm so glad I didn't get down like I told you I told you like it's amazing like what a
masculine Essence can do so that's another reason it's under attack because if they can remove the masculine Essence from society well now you have a society
imagine a society which you can control purely with emotional arguments we're almost there we're I mean we're we are
in a matriarchy and this is why they accuse me of being an internalized misogynist because I'm able to think
through and acknowledge the flaws of what happens in society when women get power and if you want to know what happens look around you
um women fall for emotional arguments the entire time they show us a commercial you know show it's so sad and
before they get to the rational aspects of it they're already invested emotionally um and I think that virtually every
societal ill that we are facing today is because of women and I think the greatest recent example of that is the
Bud Light controversy because [Music]
women need to realize how backwards it is that it took men to stand up to say something was wrong when it was so
obviously patently wrong nobody cares for years until men stood up to it so
yeah really because it's emotional arguments and and if we also analyze I mean there's certain things that women
can do so much better than men I said this the other day I was saying to my brother my brother had his daughter here and my niece was here and I said isn't
it amazing I found this amazing so isn't it amazing the patience a mother has with a toddler
I'm like she's been listening to Peppa Pig for four hours I would lose my mind I couldn't do it I simply couldn't do it
so women have this emotionality which is so fantastic when it's properly used when it's put into place it's supposed
to be I would never drop my child off to a daycare full of men would you drop
your three-year-old child to a daycare run exclusively by males it'd be weird it's just something about it is weird I
wouldn't trust the men not to lose their temper with the kid I wouldn't understand why all these men want to be around these children all day it would
be very weird scenarios so we all understand innately our gender roles innately on some level so women have a
fantastic superpower when it's properly used but like everything on Earth if you have a superpower or any kind of power at all and it's put in the wrong
direction it can be destructive water if it's going through a dam can power a city if it's not going to damn it's a
flood so we have all this emotionality you put in the wrong direction and now they're in positions of power or whatever or they're controlling the
culture or they're controlling how uh households are run and they can fall for these emotional traps these very simple
basic emotional traps it's for Grandma the most basic dumb level and I I sit
there and say Grandma's 98 98 year olds die and I don't think she should die I'm not
saying I'm saying 98 year olds get sick who said it was covered prove it was covered she got the flu last year like
what have you lost your mind but Grandma which is funny because I think the average life expectancy is 73. so if
they've made it to 92. they've done great they've done great absolutely and I said that and people thought that that was so harsh and so mean because there
you go harsh mean emotionality yeah and emotionality is used against people which is also why they don't like
stoicism is why when you have a man who's hard to emotionally affect they also see him as a threat I've I've had it from a lot of people
I've said it from I've had some of the hate mail I've got and I I get a lot of I probably get about 10 000 emails a day
I'd say about 9 000 of them are support and one thousand of them are fervent weirdos and the weirdos are like you're a
psychopath because all this is happening to you you don't even care that it was like they're threatened by the fact that
I'm stoic they're threatened by the fact that I won't cry and lose my mind over it they're like oh he has emotional
control he's a threat because they can't lie to me they can't sell me and they want you to be emotionally incontinent
and this is another thing they're teaching men they're teaching men to act out your feelings so why are they doing that because that makes you an emotional person and you're easier to control they
don't care that that damages Society by extension because when you tell men to act out their feelings that's why you get School shooters that's why you get
rapists so I get murderers why does somebody murder someone because he's mad
he's acting out his feelings he's not a very stoic person if he goes I hate you bang right so they're teaching all this
emotional incontinence in men trying to pretend they care about Society it's destroying Society in real time they have no interest in actually preserving
anything that's important about masculinity and the only reason they're doing it is because that allows them to use emotional arguments now they can sit
and say okay these men act out how they feel so let's make them angry and they might Riot and let's make a Mariah on
this street let's leave some bricks on this street you understand what I'm saying it's all
absolutely not only done on purpose and it's kind of amazing to me that nobody sits there and understands the best way you can rebel against a slave mind and
resist a matrix it's just be the kind of person who uses logic is stoic is emotionally controlled it's physically
strong it's a strong body is a strong mind who refuses to be told or labeled as something you can't label me as a
depressed person you can't label me as some kind of disease or some kind of personality disorder you can't label me
a color I'm Andrew Tate this is who I am I work hard for my last name I understand what's right and wrong I'm gonna do my absolute best and that alone
in and of itself is an act of rebellion against you I mean Society really started going down the dream we started
getting into mental health awareness and this is maybe one of my most controversial viewpoints but I said over
and over on the show everybody needs a therapist they're talking about their feelings the truth is is that every feeling you have isn't valid doesn't
need to be explored sometimes you just have a wacky feeling and you just let it go and because I my grandfather was such
an impact on my life strongest man I've ever known didn't shed a tear at my grandmother's funeral they were together
from a time he was 17 years old until her dying day I'm certain he collapsed when he got home of course but this
traditional display of masculinity and my grandfather's perspective that a man needs to let it die in his chest you
know before uh displaying this emotion had an impact on me and when I see like
I guess to give a cultural example someone like Prince Harry you know on TV
his arms like this breathing and showing what he learned in therapy it makes me want to die a little it makes me want to
die a little when I see men acting like this completely and that's controversial because they're supposed to say oh my God he's so brave it's so stunning like
he's showing this side of him everything about Prince Harry to me is what a man
should not be absolutely what you've done to your family betraying your family allowing a woman to assert that
much control over you that you would for profit betray your family I mean everybody's got a family you know
everybody's got family issues don't even let me get started you know but the idea of selling out your family and then
going the Royal Family selling out the royal family and yeah what happened it's such a display of
what's happened to men what's happened to masculinity he's giving up his guns he's never going to do this anyway it's all of it is such a public example of
what can happen the thing is I know I know what's so interesting is I know how
miserable he is he's miserable there's no way a man can be happy in that scenario because I think masculine
happiness comes from strength and to a degree excellence and also comes from respect men want to be respected and he
doesn't respect himself his family doesn't respect him and his woman doesn't respect him I know how unhappy he is I know how unhappy she is by
extension it's just an unhappy miserable house he gave up everything and gained absolutely and utterly nothing this
whole therapy thing the reason I believe they push therapy so heavily is because it goes into something I said a little bit earlier about selfishness
if you convince somebody that they have to spend hours and hours per week sitting in a chair talking about that
feeling they had last Thursday in the kitchen it's crazy it's insane you want
to talk about creating mental illness there it is this exasperates problems this makes it worse and it also builds
this culture of absolutely not or selfishness excuse me they're trying to put you in jail for the rest of your life
effectively because they're going to enslave you and they're going to control all the money and they're going to make sure you get injections you don't need yeah yeah but you know I'm sad I got
therapy I'll talk about it later that's all they want they just want you to be so obsessed with how you feel in your own mind that you can't even look
outside of yourself and care about anything it's part of the propaganda machine it's part of the mechanism to turn us all into docile farm animals I
said this to somebody the other day they were talking about how they feel and say who cares how you feel and he goes well what do you mean well I
don't care you're telling me I know you and I don't care so all the people who
don't know you don't care the woman you want doesn't care you can't go up to a chick in a bar and say you know what
usually I'm really Charming today I'm a bit sad can you give me a pass can you let me
off go away weirdo the people the chick you want doesn't care the job you're supposed to perform at doesn't care if
the man who wants to mug you decides to pull a machete he doesn't care you can't say bro I'm on the mood for a fight
today tomorrow please nobody cares so why do you care all the people out here in the world don't care but you're gonna
sit there and you're going to carry me the only person in the world who cares you're going to walk around telling everybody trying to find somebody who gives
good luck because what's going to happen is you're going to walk around feeling sorry for yourself trying to find somebody who cares you might find
somebody who pretends to care long enough for you to get a little bit of dopamine but all in all you're wasting time in a hyper competitive world where
people like me who perform regardless of how they feel are just going to perpetually bury you and then you're
gonna sit there and wake up and go why am I a loser well because when Andrew was sad he continued to perform when Andrew was in jail his business didn't
fall apart he was doing push-ups every day his body didn't fall apart nothing about his life degraded when he was in a
jail cell surrounded by cockroaches you're in a plushy bed at home crying about what and you expect the male
world's hyper competitive so you're not allowed almost as a man to put that much importance on how you feel you don't
have time to care about it because you have too much to do this is why I find so remarkable if I feel sad I don't
think how do I stop myself I need to not feel sad I just go to work I got stuff to do I'm a man I have things to do
every single day this whole therapy garbage I can't think of a way faster to ruin your mindset and
destroy your ability to resist the Perils of life then go into therapy and the over diagnoses of everything it's
like you have this you have that and then people take that as an excuse to not ever have to get better no it now I
can be permanent because I realize that I've got this I went to the doctor and the doctor says that I have this and so that's the reason why I don't respond
I've got I've got ADHD I think now it's like one in ever two people has HD ADHD and that's why I'm not able to focus and
do my homework or complete a task or keep going to the gym every single day yeah it's a self-fulfilling prophecy and
I really can't think of a quicker way to destroy your mind than go to therapy part of me if I had time to waste
Candace which I don't because I've been on house arrest long enough and once I'm out here I'm going to enjoy myself but if I had time to waste I would love to
go to start therapy I would love to like imagine me agitate go to a therapist and
she's not going to know who I am and I'm gonna sit there I'm gonna do therapists and I'm gonna do a video I might actually do this it's actually a great idea I'm gonna do video after each
therapy about what was and just sitting there talking about okay when you were eight yeah what happened when
you were eight because when in your childhood no everything's because of my childhood not everything works that way
like it's so asinine I've actually had conversations with therapists I think twice in my life I did a TV show in
England and I had to speak to a therapist and then um I think it was another TV show two TV shows I had to
speak to these therapists and I sat there and said I don't believe in what I don't believe in your science because in
math one plus one is two and we understand that whereas with what you teach you can have a guy who doesn't drink
alcohol because his dad was an alcoholic and a guy who is an alcoholic because his dad was an alcoholic so how can you have the same scenario in two completely
different outcomes she goes oh yeah but there's general rules we can follow that's the understand the conversation I'm not a general person I'm not a
general person I'm exceptional so can we just stop wasting everybody's time here because all your general rules to apply to me I'm smarter than you what have you
achieved goodbye I'm a world champion see ya like it's garbage and I I really do believe I think there is
this Mass drive to instill the idea of absolute selfishness in people I think they're trying to when I really analyze
the ideal citizen they want the ideal citizen is yes docile and yes he's unique but he's also ultimately selfish
because then you don't care about community and I think therapy is a fantastic way to make you selfish because that's all you talk about is
when you talk about garbage yeah why you have the right to act this way even if I'm terrible yeah why did I do well you
know when I was nine a life that's really Prince Harry's book honestly is it yeah I'd say I I can only get past
the first two chapters I was like this is it should have just been called privileged you know what I mean and this is the thing these aren't even struggles
and here's the thing I I think Margaret Thatcher said the best upbringing you can have is good parents and no money
because you look at Prince Harry with the you can't talk about anything better for a perfect upbringing Royal Family
come on it's not his fault right royal family fine but he was supposed to have
gone to the Army he went to Afghanistan and supposedly he fought
but if you don't give a man struggle look what he becomes tell me the kind of man if I were to say
to you imagine a man who's never struggled in his life physically mentally everything's gone perfect for him it's boring the royal family
everything's been perfect for him his whole life is that the kind of man anybody respects that kind of man anyone wants to be and
struggle is subjective right so Prince Harry dealing with his dealing with his current problems of his wife nagging to
him that's full mental breakdown right my problems are obviously much larger but struggle is subjective to him to us
they're almost on the same level but if you were to compare them side by side they're absolutely nothing so as a man you have to build resilience and you
build resilience through going through something and building a tolerance to it and this guy's had such a privileged life that he's ended up a miserable
depressed unhappy person so this is what's actually very interesting when men come to me or young boys come to me and talk about something bad that
happened to him I said good absolutely not really good you should be glad that thing happened to you because that's the reason you're gonna be the
man who can resist the Perils of life in the future if bad things don't happen to you you're gonna end up like Prince
Harry you do want to end up like that dude do you yeah exactly so whatever life's
gonna be so easy you're gonna get to the end result and your wife's just gonna wreck you so you need to have all these bad things happen to you so you build
the mental resilience and that's another thing about masculinity and males as a whole we're trying to take that all away
from them in almost every regard and it's kind of like there used to be like Rites of Passage where a boy would
become a man that's all gone there used to be this masculine very healthy peer
pressure to be big and strong and that's all gone there used to be
I mean I don't want to use the wrong words I don't want to get attacked for it but men used to consciously not pick
on each other not bully each other but hey you can't do push-ups you're weak we'd push each other in that way shame
each other to Excellence almost we still do it to this day in this house Tristan's bigger than me he's 10 kilo bigger me six foot four I'm six foot
three I'm smaller he'll bench 160 170 kilo I can only bench like 150 kilo he'll call me for three hours like
that's just how we are so I have to get up and try again that's how men are women are too and that's what I'm really
again sorry to cut you off but I'm super against this this parenting structure where you don't want anybody's feelings to get hurt I'm one of three sisters
we're a year and a half apart we tried to kill each other you know what I mean all I would do is call my sister no one has called her ugly or more you know
what I mean I'm like you're ugly you're this you're fat that's actually good you know it makes you tougher and when you
see these only chat children who've never gone through anything their parents told them they are perfect and wonderful and I'm thinking I wouldn't
trade my childhood trying me myself just trying to kill each other you know every single day it's difficult over a t-shirt
yeah and it doesn't matter how much money you have life is always going to be difficult it doesn't matter how much you're trying to shelter your children how rich you are what family they're
born into life is going to be difficult and if there is no struggle in their life they're going to find struggle or something that shouldn't be a struggle will become a struggle for them because
their life has been so sheltered and life is hard so if you can't avoid the difficulty you may as well get very good
at it you may as get good at difficulty and it's amazing when you look at someone like Prince Harry he's just a man who has not become very good at
difficulty and he's just completely collapsed in the face of a woman who's complaining at him and
yeah the even worse than all that the dishonor of of selling out we were talking about how I feel a duty to my
bloodline and my last name and I have to do my father proud he's from the British royal family like and he had no honor he
couldn't even sit and say look listen I couldn't even shut up for them yeah literally he had to sell out in a book
like God does not smile favorably on people who make these side of decisions and I think that's why he's going to be
unhappy for a very long time and he's going to realize that it was never worth it and what did he do it for money from
the royal family my friend you really need money that bad like it's it's truly shameful and I think to see in treachery
are the most heinous and most disliked personal qualities or something you can
actually witness somebody do I think everybody hates them and it's because anybody can fall victim to them anybody
can fall victim to deceit or treachery because you trust that person
everybody trusts someone right so that person turns on you you're always in trouble so I think he he thinks that he
has the populace on his side but I don't think he understands that when you out yourself as a snake everybody
intrinsically dislikes you even if they enjoyed watching the show oh completely they've stepped away and went okay
because I gave the example on my show you know you have the Kardashian family and but the one thing about them is they
they're thicker than thieves so America does like a reality show right like a reality show but the reason why they have gained popularity is because
actually they always back each other up they still remained a family unit and when you betray that when you betray
family I think left and right you just kind of go okay maybe that was a little too much it was fun to watch fun to
watch but but we don't really trust you I don't want to be your friend I want to be afraid yeah completely I mean you're
gonna sell your own brother out what am I to you right if you do that to your own brother what am I to you absolutely crazy and then he wonders why and I also
think what he probably doesn't understand maybe he's watching this you never know he might hello Harry who's watching this I don't think he
even understands that even his woman views him that way even Megan views you that way even Megan looks at you and
goes I complained at you over William and you were supposed to tell me to be quiet and you didn't so now I think
and you wonder why she's never happy so now he's in big trouble I don't know what he's going to do with his life but
he's in big trouble but it's kind of it's interesting where I don't see how it's actually an
interesting conversation to have about how psyops can work as a whole because when I analyze especially as a man and I
always talk from the masculine frame not because I'm a misogynist but because I'm a man and I understand the mask and frame because I am a man
if you stray from the ark type of masculinity if you stray from honor courage if you're not dutiful if you
don't believe in putting honor in your last name if you want to be physically and mentally strong if you don't believe in finding problems to solve you don't
believe in having a difficult life if you stray from this because you've been psyot to stray from it all you end up
with is misery and it's amazing that people will see anybody who's strayed from it end up Perma miserable and still
fall for the psyop I find it incredible that people don't think logically long enough to sit and say okay whose life do
I actually want I would never adopt the thinking of somebody whose life I didn't want
I I don't know why people even do that I could sit and have a conversation with Prince Harry for 10 hours straight and
he could be as compendous and convincing and concise and and he could be extremely perfectly articulate with his
points and at the end of it I'd say yeah but I don't want to be you so I don't want to think like you so get but
I wouldn't want to listen to him so I I don't know why people don't even just wake up and go okay whose life do I want
to live what kind of person do I want to be who do I want to be like that's the kind of thinking I need to adopt and install in my mind because we're all being programmed by someone to a degree
and I don't think you can escape programming you can just choose the programming that you are going to install inside of your mind I'm not
going to sit and say I'm not program my father programmed me my fight coach programming the friends I have around me programming my brother programs me my
Social Circle programs maybe we're all programmed to a degree you have to be very careful who you're going to allow give you the programming because if you
put it up to society and culture the current culture as a man you're gonna end up like Prince Harry do you want to
be Prince Harry it's a big question the answer is no yeah the answer is no it's
interesting what you said earlier about putting things back to biology because a lot of human nature is certainly animalistically biological biological
and even if we look at Harry and Megan and how they interact in their home I
obviously don't know but I can almost guess to the T the arguments they're having I can imagine him saying I gave
up my family for you you just what you wanted I gave you what you wanted why why why aren't you happy I gave you
everything you liked and he's trying to use a logical or an emotional he's trying to use an emotional argument but they ain't going to work because she
doesn't respect him but he's trying to use a logical argument with her trying to understand why she treats him so
badly after he completely not only complied but humans are biological and she as a woman wanted him to be a man she wanted him to have some degree of
parameter and barrier and if you don't put up any parameter or a barrier as a man what a woman's gonna do is she's
going to push you and push you and push you and push you he's going to see how far she can push you that's the reality of it we can talk about any relationship
whether it's Mary and uh sorry Harry and Megan or any other relationship if you're a full-grown man and you don't
set parameters or set barriers the woman's gonna push you and push you and push you until she eventually finds one
and we're going can also we can look at that in a romantic relationship but also people people in general if you're going
to give to a taker they're going to take and take and take and take until you eventually say no that's how humans work so she was waiting for him on a
biological level to stand up and be a man and say listen you've joined the royal family you're right you had to bow to the Queen of England correct because
it's the royal family get over it that's what that's all he had to do you're gonna save himself all this mess be
could have saved himself all the running away and looking like a fool and upcoming divorce and all this garbage dude just put his foot down he never did
and she was trying to inspire in him the warrior I think a woman sometimes tests
a man to say okay how much will he put up with because they want to see are you a man or not what if what if a man's
given you what will you do they want to see if you're about it and she was just testing him and he failed every time and that's why he's tried to Perma
please her and now he's in a situation where he's asking her while she why she's unhappy when he's giving her everything she wants and she's unhappy
because you gave her everything she wants because you're a punk women don't want neutered men they don't if they
even if they personally neuter them themselves it's not what they want in the end so I'll ask the question what do
you think men want in women that's a really good question and I can answer that one easily I think
that the masculine realm that we operate in is based on respect I think that men
are constantly looking for a way to be respected I think the world is hyper competitive and we're constantly always
looking for status amongst our peers this is why you will see a man give up his basically entire life to do
something which will only gain him respect even in a very small sphere there are CEOs who go to work every day
and don't even see their family and give up their entire life and work 12-hour days just to feel like the man in that office feeling important in that one
office in that one skyscraper is worth him giving up his life because he feels like he Mars and if he gets more respect
in that office than he does at home or anywhere else that's where he's going to want to be men function on that so if I
had to build the ideal woman who could get any man on Earth what she would have
to do is understand that I need to give my man as much status and as much respect as possible I by extension of
him being next to him need to make him look respected and a lot of this is the easy things we know no one's going to
respect the man who's with an ultra promiscuous woman men no one's going to respect the man who's with a woman who is back talking to him or horrible to
him in public no one's going to respect the man as a woman who clearly isn't interested in him sexually whatever that's all the obvious part but the
hidden actual message behind all of it is that men are constantly looking for status and respect and a woman who makes
her man feel respected not only from her but from his peers it's the kind of
woman a man is never going to want to lose so if I had a woman and I came home with all five of my friends and she came
in the house and said came in the room who's hungry you don't want any food it's not about food I'm the G now I'm
the big boss my woman wants to feed all of us of the guys there most of their chicks won't would never do that that's
respect that status for me that elevates my status so I think as a woman if you
truly if you're watching this and you want to keep a man happy you need to wake up and say how can I improve the status of my man to his peers how can I
make him look more important to the world and as long as you take that basic mental frame you can extrapolate that
out to anything your man's not going to feel high status and important if you've had a whole bunch of sexual partners because you're promiscuous so obviously
that's the Downs that's no he's not going to feel high status and important if you belittle him in front of his friends or you argue with him in front of his friends he's not going to feel
high State it's important if you disagree with him on small minor issues about if he votes one way just vote the
same way like these small votings not small thing but these things make the man look and charge it increases and
status and that's what he's most interested in a woman so that's what men are looking for for the whole that's the secret for the women who are out at home
they were going men are hard to please no men are actually very simple to please make him feel important and make him look important that's it since when

from Families my parents are divorced your parents were divorced I think your parents maybe last a little longer than
my parents totally positive what was your mother like I don't think I've learned anything about her yeah so I had
a fantastic mom she did what a mother was supposed to do I guess I was raised in a hyper I call it hyper traditional
the modern world will call it mask we'll call it misogynistic household my father was in charge it was his household my
mother was in charge of feeding us and clothing us and sending us to school and she did a fantastic job
I think that as a boy as as a man I always want to emulate my father my
father was a superhero so my father instilled a lot of the mindset that I have but my mother did a lot of the
basic things that kept me alive if if that makes sense um she was a fantastic mom and she's
still alive today and I love her very much one of the first things I did when I got rich was retire her completely so she is one of the people I take care of
and I'll take care of the rest of her life and she did the absolute best she could and uh that's the reason we moved to England they decided to get divorced and
England has a better social care system we had no money so uh we got moved to
England and I grew up in Luton which is the worst town in England in an area called Marsh Farm which is the worst
area of the worst town so it's like as bad as you can get like the worst place you can possibly go I think my school
had a four percent pass rate or something ridiculously low so I grew up in a really bad area but my mother yeah
she was fantastic and she did the absolute best she could and uh she always loved my father to the end
but I think my father in many ways almost there's certainly been a lot of circumstances where he sacrificed his
marriage to raise us in a very particular way because he he my mother and father would argue most over the
raising of me and Tristan because my dad was so hard on us but he said look you boys are my legacy are more important
than arguing with their mother so I think that's actually why they broke up because it was so hard on us but um I thank him for it so yeah but I I I don't
want to I don't want to disrespect my mother my mother by saying there isn't much more to say besides the fact she was a very nice very loving very
attentive mother that's what she did but my dad was always my superhero I I don't
know what else to say my dad was my superhero I see it now my son's only two and he just he's now toddler terrorist
wakes up every day wants to go to war I don't want to go to I just want to love him yeah and so he just he is obsessed
with my husband I mean forget it the second my husband walks the doors I don't even exist right forget the fact when I held him for 10 months I don't
exist but unless he's sick yeah yeah oh then it's like totally mommy mommy oh completely oh okay okay so when you want
to go to war all day and you're feeling great it's like Dad he literally just wants to fight him he just he goes up and he hits him and he wants him to be
thrown around and I don't want to do it like you're kind of big I don't want to toss you around go find your father
um so there actually is a natural proclivity that goes on there too where like in the way he acts when a man walks
in the door Any Man by the way he he my son wants their attention you can see that he seeks their approval at the age
of two he wants to be he'll cry in front of the girls you know it's me it's my assistant if it's girls he's putting on
that one of the guys are there he's much more he instantly stops the crying and stops the tears so it's so interesting
to watch that and examine that and just a two-year-old so well that's biological right this is how we charge the gunfire
this is how men charge at the gunfire because we want the respect of our peers we will literally commit suicide for the
respect of our peers like it's something that's deep inside of us where it used to be it should be they're trying to take it away from us but how do you get
men to go over the trench over the line and charge up machine guns well you do it because everyone else is doing it and
you don't want to be the only so you have to do it and you have to die like that doesn't make sense think about it logically it doesn't make any sense
logically but it's something biological inside of all of us because we have this innate feeling of Duty and honor and that's where the courage comes from and
they're trying to destroy that along with everything else but you're right this is how men biologically uh are designed to be and I was the same when I
was young I remember looking at my dad just going you're a superhero and I want to be a superhero that's just how that's how it was so uh but yeah my mother's
fantastic and I love her very much and she's very proud of me and she's very proud of how we were raised and she's so glad we're strong even when we were in
jail she was very concerned but she's like look I know that if anyone can do it you can do it and uh yeah so
do you want to be married good question I heard that's the lover boy tactic we'll talk about that in a
little bit but and that's an interesting question because younger me
younger me would say no absolutely not and and the reason younger me would say no is because I've
come up with all the arguments that there's no legal Advantage really and the woman can wreck you and you can lose
all of your things Etc what's the point
I don't want the government involved in my life all those kind of arguments but as I get older maybe I'm getting a bit
softer maybe I do think sometimes you need to make a decision based purely on love and have the faith of of love and
faith in your love enough to to say I don't care what the government's going to do about this
because I truly believe in us and I think we're going to make it so would I get married perhaps some point yes in
the future I might get married yeah I'm not against marriage like I used to be I used to be super against it and I think that's because I grew up in a
environment where everybody was divorced everyone so it's like well what's the point in this oh wait so I give her half
my stuff and then what what I don't I didn't understand the whole point of it but now I think if I met the right woman
perhaps yes yeah marriage is is good yeah convert me yeah if it's the right person
should marry the right person and I'm saying to someone who grew up with divorced parents um well they got they got divorced after
I was out of the house but it and this gets it speaks to your earlier point about it either impacts you one
way or the other either want marriage because your parents are divorced you don't want marriage I desperately wanted marriage and I think the ways in which
we both have grown yeah um and the confidence that it gives you I think there is something about people
like how do you do it every day because you cannot impact my life is so stable the nucleus of our household is so
stable and to be able to raise kids and have them see that example of the perfect Ian and the Yang there's
something Divine about it there's something spiritual about it it's why I won't accept you I think you are actually a Libertarian right now and I
won't accept you as a Libertarian I think you will not be one in a few years if I had to make a prediction I think
you will lean towards conservatism because even in just the crack of you talking about the attack on masculinity
because first you say oh well if everyone wants to do what they want to do if you guys all agree and you want to be homosexual is fine but then you'll
start to realize that that libertarianism Live and Let Live is what welcomes in through the door I'm you
know very against every every ill that homosexuality has brought and again these are two these are consenting people that are doing what they want to
do this is true but look evil is evil Sin is Sin and where yesterday talking
about homosexual marriage today we're talking about transition well it's such a slippery slope this is the thing right you're completely right because the idea
of Live and Let Live was a fantastic one if it could actually operate without slippery slopes into sending it to Canada chaos and Anarchy and it can't so
this is the difficult thing about it you get called a bigot for saying this is my line I don't agree with this and you're going to be called bigoted you're going
to be attacked but truthfully it's just understanding that like you're saying it's a slippery slope and it's
unfortunate what is the slope that we want then okay then we should Aspire towards heterosexual relationships you can Inspire towards marriage and this is
this is the mold that I am selling all the time wouldn't have said this 10 years ago I was probably more
libertarian when I first got into politics and oh what's the big deal if people want to do this to themselves and
then I realize no there there is a reason yeah um no and you're completely right the reason I gave that example is
because I'm currently in illegal Jeopardy where or a legal situation where people who have nothing to do with
are my life are trying to say that people were victims when they weren't when everyone was consenting and you're right I agree with you there I also
think with the whole LGBT argument it's interesting because I will be honest and say I do think there is a difference between G and T I think they are
different things of course they're massively different things however you're right it's a shame it's
such a slippery slope where you can't just say to people Live and Let Live because it's going to be hijacked and Trojan Horse and they're going to Trojan
Horse it and they're going to inject something in it that destroys the lives of every single person on the planet and they're going to try and do it so you have to draw a hard line you have to be
a bigot you have to never give an inch because if you give an inch they take 10 miles more than 10 miles look at let me look where we're at I mean
[Music]
none of it makes any sense and but these are real evils that we're fighting today and I think it's because we haven't put
those firm lines in the sand and said no actually there is such a thing as right and wrong well this is the thing I love about and this is where religion comes
in right because I used to be an atheist and then you exactly what you just said about there's something Divine about
marriage and exactly like you said there's such a thing as Sin everything you're talking about is religious you're completely correct you eventually if
you're going to wake up and be the kind of person who has hard parameters and said this is right this is wrong it's very difficult to do that without then
turning and understanding that has to come from God who else is going to decide what is right and what is wrong
and people say oh they're all man-made religions well then why does it go against so many of the wills of man some
of the sins that men want to go and do the religions are against if we made a religion a religion wouldn't be against our own sins would it right so it's it's
it's interesting that this is almost proof for God in so many ways when you're going to wake up and realize that there is genuine evil in the world and
there's genuine good in the world and there are two sides and two camps and I do believe that the good is on the side of Truth and I do believe that comes
from God and there's many different ways to God I think there is one God and there's different religions and I don't
argue that the differences between between the religions because I think we have a lot more in common than we have uh especially in the fight against evil
than we have as differences but yeah it's super interesting and you're right firm lines are absolutely not really required and and if we don't have them
it's why societies ends up in the position to sin with so many subjective lines and your truth my truth the truth
or and you're and you're completely correct it's not very often I sit with somebody who I feel like says something and I feel corrected but you're right
Live and Let Live is hijacked it's hijacked and it's unfortunate it that me
as a person now especially and maybe this is a personal maybe this is more of a personal thing
maybe it's more of a personality trait where I'm in the position I'm in I'm saying what I believe is the truth and
I'm out here trying to help people and I'm saying about the difficulties I went through my life so others don't have to
go through them just as you said but if somebody doesn't want to listen to me I'm like okay you don't want to listen to me I don't care you do what you want
but that Live and Let Live mind frame can be hijacked because what I'm saying to people okay don't do what
I want or don't do what I believe to be good don't do what God believes to be good do what you want I don't care and then they get in a large enough group
and they end up attacking morale it redefines yeah normalcy redefines morality and you know I recently was saying I'm having a conversation with a
friend of mine Brandon and I when I first got into politics I wasn't so staunchly against homosexual marriage I
didn't speak out on certain things abortion and then I saw it firsthand I would I just examined just the
differences in my relationships with heterosexual couples and homosexual couples and homosexual couples I'm talking about two men you don't realize
that God designed a man to be with a woman because it prevents men from giving from giving entirely into the
worst components of who men are section just having sex they can't do that if you're with a
woman okay maybe it's menstruation maybe it's pregnancy maybe it's after birth but there are these natural barriers
that make it so that your relationship has to be about something else other than just sex when I'm with my
homosexual friends they talk about sex I don't think they realize that heterosexual couples don't just sit down for lunch and be like we banged 20 times
last night because we could they think that that's normal so then you talk about how that bleeds into pornography that bleeds into want to talk about
sexuality in the classroom how that might bleed in to suddenly wanted to speak to Children about sex and all this
is all normal it's actually not normal but because it's normal in a homosexual relationship you think that it's
actually normal totally right so I have suddenly realized and this is why I become so starchly conservative how it
all bleeds into everything and there is such a thing as objective rightness and there is such a thing as objective wrongness completely correct and I agree
with absolutely everything you just said so my question would be then what do we do do we force everybody to be Christians or Force everybody to be
religious or how do we do it well I think the first thing is Having the courage to talk about it and and nobody even talks about these topics anymore
because they just go oh they've won so we need to let this go and and more and more you're seeing culturally people are
afraid of being canceled I mean what I just said to you is grounds for cancellation how dare you question this how dare you I even believe now after
seeing the ways in which society has made children children believe that they're all trans I didn't I went to
University I went to high school I didn't graduate with a single trans person now you want me to believe one in four children suffers from identity
issues no that's socialization you place that on them so is it such a far stretch to imagine that the same happened in the
homo section when homosexuality came to America and then we popularized it and we put Helen Ellen on TV and we gave
Melissa Etheridge a platform and suddenly Pride parades were happening everywhere whereas you don't see this here you don't because you don't see
this here in Romania because we haven't this is the power of culture this is the
power of Pop Culture when you make something you have to go the other way you need to normalize it you need to you
need to say actually this is abnormal absolutely and this is what normal is and it's not both so yeah I've become
very conservative in all these perspectives if you're completely correct you nailed it when I when I I said do we force someone to be Christian
you nailed it by changing to the exact thing I was going to say it's about culture it's a cultural issue and it's
completely Nutley correct and I think that's actually one of the reasons why I mean I don't State this with arrogance I
don't want people to understand I'm not trying to be arrogant I'm trying to make people understand the situation I'm in I was the most Googled man on the planet
at one point so I had a massive impact on the culture and it was dragging in the complete opposite direction that the
culture wants to move in I'm dragging men in the complete opposite direction that the satanists and the people who
want to turn us all into slaves want us to go in so I think that anybody who sits at home and realizes that my legal
troubles appearing basically directly after that is a coincidence then you're awfully naive so it's it's unfortunate
also that the way the world works at a certain level of influence and power the justice system almost breaks down we see
that even in America and most other countries all just becomes a big game and a Big Show and it's about power plays and a whole bunch of conversations behind the scenes it's not about Justice
anymore so it's very it's very concerning because you are right we are in a culture war and it's culture which
is absolutely not really defining the direction in which we move and this is one of the reasons why I reverted to
Islam because I feel like the Islamic culture is the strongest you feel the culture you feel it you were Christian
and you know I definitely do not know enough about the Islamic faith to sit
here and debate you on it I'm never a person that will debate somebody on something that I'm not an expertise on but
I will say that I'm sad that you're not a Christian anymore because I and I I can sense perhaps it's because you felt
that Christians weren't doing a good job defending their beliefs yeah I think that God should be feared
I believe that God should be feared I Fear God it's one of the only things I fear and I believe that also
you see God to degree or you see religion how you see yourself
and I see myself as a person of strong principles and strong morals and I like to think of myself as the kind of person
nobody really wants to cross not because I'm a psycho but because I'm a man of capability and I'm smart and I'm strong
and nobody wants to make an enemy of me so I feel like I find an affinity to a belief system which has very similar
outlooks and there's a whole bunch of other things I can say from the Quran and Islamic texts Etc but to keep it
very vague and very broad for people who are not Islamic I felt God when I was in
an Islamic country if I went to an Islamic country I felt God you don't feel any God how is it a
Christian country if satanists are mocking Jesus on the streets I I
understand what you're saying and I I was trying to gather in my head what made him what pulled him away from
Christianity and I said it's probably the example if you're thinking that America is a Christian country and
you're thinking that the United Kingdom is a Christian country they're not they're not going Christianity is getting it wrong and the truth is that
America is no longer a Christian country we're being run by people that are satanic Hollywood is satanic and
Hollywood is running America right so you're not wrong but I think that right now America is facing a spiritual battle
and for the first time in a very long time Christians are starting to stand up and speak about our principles I hope so
and I could have used you I know but I have seen in California
I've seen Christians and Muslims get side by side when they were complaining about the LGBT I did see the schools which is fantastic and I know what
you're saying saying and that is true but it's almost like when I go to an Islamic country I feel God around I you
see it you see it in the way the people are dressed you see it and the fact that everyone's in a family you see it in the
fact that there's a mosque on every corner it's in the air and it's almost like when I'm in Dubai and I'm talking
to my friends my Islamic friends and I explain to them the things you have to protect your child from in an American school they literally think I'm lying
they're like no surely like it's my vending to them not African countries
that are Christian okay so yeah this is interesting so yeah they still are mind blown by the concept of what we're fighting in America America is unique we
shouldn't say that this is the blanket you're right they're right there are Christian countries which still stay Christians what do you mean men can be
women like they think you're crazy and we're in Romania and Romania is a country which is very conservative and very very Christian and they don't buy
into any of this garbage none of it so this is absolutely not only true it's unfair to say all Christian countries are like America's exception and not not
in a good way yeah I think they're like the whole West is unfortunately the West the West is I've stayed on my show the entire time the West is falling the fact
that we're even having these debates is is not good yeah the West has fallen and unfortunately Russia Christian country
yeah absolutely a very Christian country so yeah you are right but I've I felt an affinity to Islam I felt gold in the air
and it's it's difficult for me to explain any other way okay that's fair enough I I won't push you any further on
that all right let's get to your case that's happening today so and why conservatives are screaming about it in
America and why they feel that Tucker didn't push you enough on this case push me okay so first and foremost one thing
I want to clarify people that are watching this is that there seems to be this understanding
that you are being prosecuted or you're being indicted rather for human sex trafficking charges I've read the
indictment and I do want to make it clear the words human sex trafficking occur on the indictment but then it very
makes it very clear that what they're referring to is they've kind of extended the term it's not what we think about in America when you think of a bunch of
children being put into a truck and taking over the Border against their will they're basically saying that if
you if you trick a woman into coming into a country by using the lover boy method then they consider that to be
human sex trafficking so the definition has definitely expanded over time so it's also ridiculously misogynistic to
believe that women can't make their own decisions on anything so the whole thing about it is misogynistic but yeah you're correct that's a very important
distinction essentially what they're saying is we have a show in America called 90 Day Fiance that is the lover boy method is women that that go over to
the U.S they're clearly coming for citizenship but these women kind of get duped and they get they sponsor these people this would be the same vein of
what they're trying to describe I've read it myself of what human sex trafficking can be which is it's not a woman fell for you fell in love moved
over here overseas but it's only because you were very convincing that is the definition given in the indictment of
what they're referring to correct so I I'll give a very quick rundown on the case everything from these old videos
old clips my webcam company things that happened 10 years ago have absolutely nothing to do with the correct case absolutely zero anything you see from
before 2021 has nothing to do with the case the case against me is that from 2021 my brother and I when we were
already worth hundreds of millions of dollars and already successful and famous create an organized criminal group and Our intention was to convince
women to move to Romania to make Tick Tock videos so we could steal the tick tock money and Tick Tock and they
mention only fans correct on the indictment page and they say that you did this using the lover boy method and
it almost reads what's interesting to me why I was compelled by this case is just that because they tremendously changed
it when they were investigating you we were told that there was a woman who went to the UN who escaped your grip and
that you know she she said I've been held captive and then after they investigated they came up with what it
sounded like regurgitated Andrew Tate videos they love our boy method which is in one of your videos where you're
talking about women so it seems like during that time where they held you in the cell perhaps the initial case that
they fed to the media fell apart yeah I believe what happened and I have to be very careful what I say but what I
believe happened is in April of last year Tristan and I had some visitors
here from America who were only in the country for five days made some very
strange demands financially when they were rejected they called the American Embassy and said they had been kidnapped
those two women we deem now to be professionals one of
them has accused seven men of kidnapping in her life and she's also lawyered up instantly from a left-wing NGO because
she's currently being sued by us for false charges and she seemed to be very well supported and funded so I don't
know if she was sent as an agent we're not entirely sure so this is a very interesting beginning to all of this in April the Romanian authorities arrested
US for precisely two hours and threw it out and knew it was all garbage from the beginning the case remained open nobody
understood why the case remained open my lawyer made repeated requests to close the case they wouldn't close the case and it remained open and absolutely not
really dormant when I was canceled when I was deleted across all social media and canceled and lost my bank accounts
my Uber account my stripe account my Gmail absolutely everything literally within the same week the case was picked
back up which was very strange I was followed they tried to find evidence of any kind of crime at all they couldn't
find any crimes whatsoever they then raided my house for a second time with the intent of getting my electronics
which they got they went through all of my electronics and they could find nothing of actual Criminal Intent what
they did find is my brother and I and our personal assistant because at the time if anyone who knows on the Internet
or has been around for a while will remember my face was all over Tick Tock you could not get rid of my face on Tick
Tock me and my brother were explaining our strategy for how we got so big on Tick Tock to some friends of ours they
then said that we were forcing them to do the tick tocks for our money for our brand they made this huge reach and said
it's human trafficking because we're forcing women to make Tick Tock videos yeah so that's the part that registered
to me as strange it started as a kid we were told it was kidnapping which is quite it's very serious that somebody
fled to the U.S embassy this is the woman that you're talking about that you say but you're alleging has also accused
seven other men it's literally now on Twitter you can see the file the complaint we filed against our seven men
she is accused of kidnapping she's done it with seven different boyfriends who didn't buy her what she wanted one of them killed himself okay wow
so she's a professional okay so it's very strange that she she comes over she accuses you of kidnapping her but then they decide not to prosecute that but
they fed that to the media that you kidnapped someone she fled to the U.S embassy then all of a sudden we learned
that they're investigating you and the charges then go from kidnapping to well actually what he was doing is a lover
boy method which we're saying is human sex trafficking and that these women didn't know what he what they were
getting into they thought that he was going to marry them and actually what he wanted them to do was just to make Tick Tock and only fans videos yeah so the
Loverboy method traditionally the way it would traditionally work the reason it was criminalized added to the criminal code is that I would be a Romanian man
and I would meet a Romanian girl we would get married marriage is part of it I'm not married to anybody we'd get
married we'd move to a richer country you go from a poor country to a rich country let's say America you put the girl into sexual work let's say
prostitution and then I'll keep all the money and I'll I'll control her or coerce her by pretending to love her
that's what they're saying that's how it traditionally Works they've accused me of using the Loverboy method because baseball was a nice person I was nice
that's the thing that so most people don't understand what the law is so ridiculously subjective if they want to weaponize it and use it to attack you
that's exactly what they'll do they can accuse any man of using the lover boy method if you send nice messages on a text message you're like hey baby
how are you so did you did you did you promise to marry these women no I didn't promise to marry anybody what I had was
girls the two girls who were in the criminal file asked me how to be famous on Tick Tock I told them how to be famous in Tick Tock and I spoke to him
nicely the entire time these two women have come out and made videos repeatedly saying we're not victims of anything I
don't know if you've seen them no okay so you're so just right back the victims the victims in the indictment correct have made videos saying we're not
victims correct I did not know that that's there it's all over Twitter in fact on my I think it's my pinned tweet
you can see the criminal case against Andrew Tate the two victims who the decar are accusing me of using Loverboy method on have made videos saying he
just told us how to do social media we're not victims I've never seen any of them being aggressive
or rude they've always respected respected people I forced I mean inside them no no
no no
they gave this statement to the police the police ignored it and said they're brainwashed so they ignore it so now we
have a criminal case where we have girls who are saying they're not victims of anything me telling girls how to make
money on Tick Tock or not how to make money because no one makes money on Tick Tock telling them how to get famous on
Tick Tock and them saying that I forced them for money which doesn't exist there's no money in the criminal file there's no transactions there's no
financials nothing the girls themselves have given statements in my defense they're being thrown away so they can
continue with this case saying that I've Brainwashed the women so now we have imagine in court my brother and I and
the two victims all on the same side saying nobody's done anything wrong
we're all friends friends we were talking about Tick Tock accounts and then you have the state with no Witnesses on its own saying you're
victims and you're bad and you're going to jail so it seems like what they're doing then is this is where the content
from 10 years ago is coming into play where they're saying to even yeah they're complaining this now so even though this these charges are from and I
read the indictment again 2021 we are but look at what he said 10 years ago which somehow confirms what we're saying
we don't have to listen to these women on August 22nd brics Nations that's Brazil Russia India China and South
Africa are expected to announce the launch of a new international super currency fully backed by gold or other
Commodities this is part of their long-term plan to supplant the U.S and the dollar as cornerstones the Global
Financial system you can protect your IRA or 401K from Fallout from this Landmark Announcement by diversifying
with gold from Birch gold historically gold has been a safe haven in times of high uncertainty which is right now when
currencies fail gold is a safe haven how much more times a dollar have we don't know protect your savings with gold
Birch gold has an A plus rating with a Better Business Bureau plus thousands of happy customers so text Candace to
989898 and get your free info kit on gold if a central bank digital currency becomes reality it will be nice to have
some gold to depend on again text Candace to 989898 so I do want you to contextualize
this video that has been circulating on the internet of you talking about the lover boy method so we'll take a look at
that right now sure you cannot go to work you having fun so the recruitment process is the same
as the PHD course you message them on Instagram the PHD course is my recruitment system I don't
mention webcam until after I've had sex with a girl if
you're on dates and you're trying to mention it and it just doesn't work it puts them off I'd never do that
that's disgusting I'm not a uh it's just not gonna work you continue as normal no mention of
webcam you girl after your girl you do the PHD test
if she passes to PhD test and she wants to be with you then you start mentioning things like
yeah but you know you're always busy you're always at work you can come work for me okay so first question when was
this video taken yeah so this video is from 10 years ago and this is me explaining how having a webcam company
is actually a larger video as a whole I'm explaining how having a webcam company can affect your relationships and how it affects your dating life it
also explains the fact that one of the girls I was dating at the time was working on webcam at the time and it's
explaining my general overall explains my life and how things are
affected owning a pornography company because obviously a lot of women will be put off by that it doesn't explain
it doesn't say I'd be very careful I'll answer this question because I'm currently under an investigation right
so I'd be very careful I answer it people are trying to chop it up and say that it says I am using uh the Loverboy
method to somehow convince women to do things they didn't want to do this is obviously not the case and none of this is in the case file for a reason because
it doesn't exist and all these women are upset but this is simply me explaining it's actually a dating course I made a long time ago and I'm a little bit
embarrassed about it to be honest with you because it was 10 years ago and I was talking about women and dating and
things in a way that I wouldn't talk about them anymore right so yeah you look very young in the video I'm super young and I'm talking about hey when you
sleep with this girl or you meet that girl or you meet this girl on Instagram and I have a webcam company I don't tell
them I have a webcam company and I just think all that's kind of crass and it's below me yeah and I don't really like talking about it and it's amazing how
things change as you mature and you get older but once again I was a much younger man I think if you were to take
any 24 year old and look at the stuff he puts on the internet some of it's going to be stupid and I think if you look at anybody who made things 10 years ago Something's Gonna Be Stupid it's
absolutely not really not criminal in any regard there's nothing criminal about it has no bearing or any interest in the current case but yeah I was
talking about how I talk I don't mention I have a webcam business the basic premise of the video was me explaining that I don't mention I have a webcam
business ever and that I'm Mr rich and I have this nice car and I go on dates with girls and sometimes when I say I
have a webcam business some of them want money and they want to work for me that's the basic premise of it right I I'm glad to hear that you're not proud
of the video and I think that that's one of those things where I say that people don't allow you to grow up from things
that you've done or said in the past and this is obviously when you were operating a webcam business you're talking about and that's the whole thing
about The Human Experience we're supposed to grow right and we're supposed to make mistakes and we're supposed to learn from them and we're supposed to uh evolve as people and I'm
certainly not proud of the video when I say I'm not sorry for what I've done I don't mean it in a I would do the same
things again I don't mean it that way I mean at the time I was a lot less knowledgeable and I was younger and I made some mistakes and just like I'm
sure Jay-Z would never crack sell crack again right exactly the same reason I would never make a stupid video saying something so stupid again I also could
have never never predicted the fact that I was going to become one of the most famous people on the planet right I didn't see that coming and if I did I
would have been a lot more careful with what I said and how I said it and I do think that it's part of every
person's journey to make some mistakes and learn from them and grow them and I kind of find it interesting that if I was a reformed drug addict there'd be no
problem if I was a reformed murderer there'd be no problem if I was a Mafia Boss and I'd sit here and I'd kill three people and we were doing an interview
and I was like yeah I used to kill people I've done my time I'm out of jail now that I get less Flack than if I made a video talk about dating when I used to
have a business that did webcam that I currently get you know so all I can do is understand that I was a younger man I
did the best I could at the time and uh I was trying my very best to survive in a very harsh world and I I
understand now that a lot of the way I said things I certainly shouldn't have said them that way but none of it is Criminal right and it again has no
bearing on your case today but there's literally no bearing and it's conflation it's being circulated without like
people think that video was shot last week correct and that's what's so good because it's good to mention that because people are trying to conflate
them because in the current case against me there's no case everybody understands there's no case we're now in a situation where if the
legal system is completely fair then the case is over so what they're trying to do is they're going to conflate with old videos of mine and they're going to try
and muddy the waters and Gaslight and I will say that I am unhappy those videos exist and I will say I wish I
never made them but I won't say that I'm sorry because at the time I did the best I knew how to do I think I think that's
important for the Young kids that are following you especially the young men to know like I say I
always hope that they I talk about the mistakes that I made and I probably wouldn't even categorize them as mistakes it's just things that I did and
I if I could go back of course I wouldn't do it hindsight's 2020 but it's important for them to hear that I'm not
proud of that obviously I'm not completing it and that's why I never push them to the world and that's why I
never you know propagate them in any way unfortunately there's a weaponized attack against me where they still exist
and that's why I do so so good to talk against them I think that if you have a
if you want to tell kids not to do drugs you usually have a reformed drug addict to stand up and say don't do drugs I was
a drug addict it was a mistake and I think that gives you a degree of credibility so for me to sit here and say be a lot more careful one with the
way you say things on the internet especially two be a lot more careful with your interactions with women as a
whole especially in light of the metoo movement all these other things be very respectful this video this is a small clip if you watched a video in its
entirety I actually talk about extensively about how you don't want to get make a woman feel pressured you
don't want to pick up a rape charge for no reason if she feels upset or sad make sure you get her a taxi home I talk
about all these things in the same video so this is still the worst part of a very long form video taken out of context
however I just think there's a lot of lessons to be learned from it and yeah if I have to be slightly embarrassed and a little bit taken aback by them so I
can teach people the lessons and I'm going to teach people the lessons and the basic premise is I was explaining how I have a webcam company and how it
affects my romantic life and that was how it was all encompassing and went together and I think when I made the video I got like 28 views yeah and now
it's being circulated and now it's being circulated and I'm being told I'm the worst person in the world by people who pretended they'd never done anything wrong for the last 10 years and also
there has to be a degree of time I like to think there's a statue of limitations like how long
are you going to hold they will for the rest of your career I'm sure they will and it's fine and that's fine but I mean
it's just like okay 10 years ago 10 years a decade yeah they're going to keep making you answer for it in every capacity I've seen that in God forbid
you misspeak you miss a word while you're saying something they will circulate it over and over again that's just the world of social media for me
what I feel is I don't feel guilty about them but I do feel embarrassed because I don't feel like the way I spoke about
women or the way I spoke about romantic relationships is my current view on romantic relationships I think I've certainly matured I was a young Brash
arrogant Guy this is what happens when you have a young kickboxer who's beating everyone up making a bunch of money from
the streets I was a young Brash arrogant guy and I spoke in a way I perhaps shouldn't have spoke and I'm sure if Jay-Z makes a song today he won't speak
about women and crack and drugs the way he used to speak about women and cracking drugs it's just the reality of life and you have to grow and you have
to take the embarrassment which comes from growing so I will certainly sit here and make sure I think the whole world understands that that's not my
message that's not why I'm teaching young boys today the Young boys who are following me today I have no interest in
these videos and don't watch these videos unless they're pushed by haters and I think that overall I'm a net
positive for the world I think that men being so disenfranchised is
I want to say something quickly about the British school system the English school system has attacked me now they're trying to put me they've spent
billions of dollars trying to remove me from schools because young boys were running around saying what color is your Bugatti and repeat repeating my sayings
I don't think I can really truly be held responsible for the fact that young boys repeat a saying especially one that's
not particularly aggressive I think that shows that the young boys are looking for a hero and someone to look up to and I feel like I'm feeling a gap and that's
why I understand it's so important I say very good things and teach very good things and I don't think I would have learned
so much good if I hadn't been involved to a degree with the dark and the bad I don't think there is light without dark
a lot of my lessons and a lot of the messages I give to the world come from the fact that I grew up in one of the
worst areas of the Western World surrounded by drug dealers surrounded by real pimps doing real bad things
surrounded by Broken homes I learned all these lessons and if I had never had those experiences and ever grew up in
that scenario how could I be a person who's now teaching young men disenfranchised young men the realities of the world how could I we talked
earlier about having a sheltered life a sheltered life doesn't allow you to be the kind of man who can teach so yeah I
spoke in a way I shouldn't have spoke yeah I regret the video completely have I ever heard anybody know has any of the
girls know who are being mentioned in that video come forward with anything other than defense of Me no nobody was
actually hurt it was just very Brash very arrogant very bad delivery which I regret I can tell you something right
now if love with you as a human being if I had to watch Clips with me 10 years 10 11 years ago I would be
so I would write even the black girl go red I couldn't I couldn't even look I wouldn't want my husband to see it so I
feel you're embarrassment and this is why a part of me when I was when they were regurging was because I was like this is so unfair it's so unfair to yeah
to say I'm upset and by and large the stuff that you're saying to young men even if there are certain things to
agree with although I found it interesting that you said that peacocking is natural with men because I think you're right now that you say it
I'm just a woman I don't understand it um but by and large the stuff that you're saying today is not that and so I
just I think it's really you got to be really careful if you're convicting somebody and who they were a
decade ago completely and it's reformed drug addicts that will tell you not to do drugs and it's reformed alcoholics
alcohol and I lived a life I'm not gonna sit here and try and I think part of the
reason actually and it is part of my image you know top G is the name for any of the adults who are watching it top G
is what they call me my nickname but part of it is the fact that I grew up in a bad area you know I can fight I have
this money I'm in this big compound in Romania with armed guards and there's that that degree of it there's that
nastiness and there's that rough to the edge which makes my message so interesting for the young boys to watch but that's because I came from a very
rough life and yeah all I can do is apologize for the delivery but I will not apologize
for trying to do the best I could at the time in the scenario growing up completely and I think that that's one of the things that sucks about being a
public figure is every single moment that people looking at it under a microscope and I always say I want to
give people permission I always say I took the most liberal route to conservatism that there ever was and so
I just not so quick to judge people and also I like to think and this is one of the things I do say if if the most
advanced forensic detectives on the planet with years of effort if the worst they can drag up is me talking about
women in a slightly derogatory way I'm kind of happy with that I'll be honest because I scroll Twitter and I
see all these liberals who attack people all day end up getting ousted for child porn or this or that real things and I'm like thank God I have no skeletons for
real you know so that's the worst version of me that anybody's ever gonna see and it was a long time ago and I
learned my lessons from it and uh I do my very best to teach the lessons I
learned just like you said to help people avoid going through the hardest way to possibly learn a lesson and that's that's the reality of it but that
has no bearing on my current case and I think that's what the confusion with my case is currently people think that my
case has something to do with that even though they're completely unrelated events right and that's why I'm trying to clarify and talking to you because I've realized that there's a lot of
conflating going on um and a lot of it is because America I I feel is just now being sort of
introduced to you whereas in the UK you've been around for a while and there was one and I'm only familiar with your
UK brand because of my husband so I I know that you've been big in the UK circuit for a very long time and there
was an old video that surfaced of you spanking a woman with a belt
tell me you love me
you message one other guy again
this obviously has made it through the UK media for years and I know I know
what that is based on my understanding of what happened with big brother when you were on Big Brother but Americans
are just seeing this video in a long Montage of awful Andrew Tate videos so I
want you to explain to them what that was and again this is another example of when the woman has already spoken out
and clarified that this was not her being abused but absolutely yeah the woman's already come forward instantly
after the video she came forward and made a video and said look this is between me and Andrew and his he never hurt me and I love him very much and
this is something that personal happened in the bedroom hello everyone um I just wanted to say something about
the video that's been released recently about me and my ex-boyfriend ninja Tate Andrew isma still great friend what you
guys saw on the video it's just what we used to do it was just pure game he's a great guy he would never hurt anyone
unless he's fighting and um I just wanted to let you know that
this is a huge misunderstanding because I heard he got kicked out from the house because of it which I found very unfair
because it was just pure game it's just what we used to do and it's actually interesting because
when I got arrested even recently even though me and her alone no longer together she was also doing videos of my defense she made a very recent video a
few months ago saying once again very nice things about me he is not a human trafficker he would never rape anybody
and he would certainly never ever human traffic anyone either including his
brother they would never do such thing I am just so shocked and I'm so fed up with all of these lies and you're right
about public life having your dirty laundry or your life thrown out there to the world is kind of interesting and
it's interesting how fast people throw stones because I know how clean my life is compared to most people's lives and I
know that just from conversations I've had at dinner tables I know from just dinner table conversations you talked earlier about dinner table conversation
people have and couples Etc I've been sitting around in very private rooms with very rich people and I've been in very important places and also some very
low places and I've heard people talk and I'm like if your life was on display like my life was on display it would be
a real circus I mean imagine you could be the son of a president imagine if their life was on display and you could
find out some really interesting things so me personally yeah these things are
the same old regurgitating things from 10 years ago they've been previously explained that was also I was going to say can you date that video when that
video I must have been how old was I in 2015 maybe 2014 okay a long time ago right
and I think the best defense for all of these things personally I don't think that anybody should take my word for it I think the best defense for all of
these things are the voices of the woman directly involved right we say believe all women right that's what we say isn't
it okay well you don't have to listen to a word I say or believe a word I say if you think I've done something wrong to a woman and the woman stands up and goes
no I love him that's garbage the next should be the end of the issue I believe maybe I'm getting libertarian again but
um no I mean I very much agree with it and this kind of gets into um gosh what is the name of the guy in
Hollywood that he just went under me too and uh hammer or something yeah Army
Hammer right and this is another person I defended on my show he's in consensual relationships hey BDSM was his thing he
was very clear but it was his thing the girls were okay with it maybe maybe because he was a Hollywood star but he
never lied he never coerced he never confused and then suddenly one of these women decides to speak out against him
now they've just cleared him of all charges and I sort of have the perspective that if they were doing this in a consensual relationship respective
irrespective of how I might examine it and say I would never do this in a consensual relationship you can't then
turn him into a rapist well this is the thing I don't think many people understand especially the men who are
vilifying me and attacking me and anyone who's upset by me understand that first they come for me and then they're gonna
come for you they come for any man that they don't like and the way they do it is this is the way weapon they sit and
go okay let's take some kind of sexual crime because it's heinous and it damages their name and then because it's
subjective right you say rape you're right rape traditionally was grab a woman off the street and hurt her well
he didn't do that but he did have a consensual relationship for years and then now his girlfriend can be convinced
to turn on him for a paycheck because the the media will hype her up make her famous and pay her a wage
now he's a rapist or even by create more crazy extension let's look at the Loverboy method we have a man here who
has spoken to a woman in a very nice polite kind way has never even had a BDC
SM relationship there hasn't her or hasn't hit or only spoke to her nicely she is saying he is nice she is saying
he did nothing okay she's brainwashed and he used Loverboy you can't even be nice anymore you can't even be if the
government want to put you in jail for sexual crime you can be a man with a woman speak to her with absolute respect
she can love you with all her heart and say he has never hurt me and you are still a criminal right right think of
that think of the mind-bending it's crazy as a man you're not safe you're
not safe if they want to get you they're going to get you and they're going to use this Avenue because this is the most heinous possible crime you can be
accused of the process itself is the punishment let's look at what's happened to me all those months of Investigation
during all those months of Investigation there are pages and pages of files everything I did everywhere I went they
were looking for me to break a law I don't break laws if I had even sped in a car if I had littered am I done anything
it'd all be in the case File so there's they're spying on my entire life trying to find a crime they can't find one then
they go through my entire personal life which is now all over the Internet we get all over the Internet so you go through the embarrassment then they seize all your money 15 million dollars
are taken up my money then I went to jail for three months now I'm on house arrest by the time I'm found innocent I've been
punished the whole the process is the punishment the process is the embarrassment the process is teaching
you a lesson so it's not even about innocent and guilty I don't think most people at home understand that if they
want to hurt you if you get to a level of influence where powerful people go you we have to damage this guy's name we're going to accuse him of sexual
crime it doesn't matter if you can prove yourself innocent three years from the point they accuse you because you've already been wrecked that's the entire
goal of it right so now we're living here I'm sitting here as a person who's accused of a crime the victims are on my
side there's no one against me but the state I've done nothing wrong there's these Twitter detectives Twitter
internet detectives who know whose funds them trying their very best to prove me guilty for no reason by taking old
videos and conflating the issue and trying to make it complicate when it doesn't need to be and I just sit here and think they are complicating the
issue I very much agree with you on that I think that the goal of digging up these old videos was to say well this somehow legitimatizes the case against
in Romania and that's just not true right you can say you even said it you're not proud of these videos you can
and say I think Andrew Tate is immoral I think the things that he said here are not principle they're trying to say that because of things you said 10 years ago
you shouldn't have a question young men today it's just too much conflation I made a pro I made pro atheist videos
back then and I'm very embarrassed of those right I'm extremely embarrassed of the videos I would sit and say God is
not real in fact I'm more embarrassed of those videos than any other video and I would sit there and now I'm I'm devout
to My Religion so I would sit there and start try and talk about how God wasn't real and I thought I was smart and now I
watch it and think I was an idiot and I like to think of myself as a pretty wise person I wouldn't have a platform if I
wasn't wise and I'm 36 years old but at 25 I was a dummy and I think that any 36
year old if you were to ask him were you a dumbass 25 I feel like young men especially take a little longer to completely for testosterone I was making
money out of Lambos fight animals beating everyone to pieces I had a few hot girlfriends I thought I was Mr Hotshot yeah like is that the worst
thing in the world like who who is it right so yeah it's it's very interesting that they're going to attack me with
these forever and that's fine I do believe however that Allah is the best of planners
and I am in many ways I wouldn't say happy
but I feel like this whole criminal investigation is going to be a fantastic end to all of this once I'm found innocent I believe and I do believe I'll
be found innocent I've seen all of the case against me and there is no case and it's very difficult to put somebody in jail when there's nobody saying he did
anything wrong for people at home who are confused about my criminal case just so they understand I'll explain it one
more time two girls in April who visited Romania for five days wanting money for shopping didn't get it accused us of
kidnapping them these are girls who've accused seven other men of kidnapping slash human trafficking Romanian authorities turn up and within an hour
said they weren't kidnapped this is stupid and threw it away then they picked up this case for some reason by some recommendation later on down the
line come up with this whole lover boy garbage the two girls there's four girls in the case two of the girls who were accused of who I supposedly lover Boyd
are on my side we have the two initial girls who said that they were kidnapped who how are on CCTV walking in and out
of the house as much as they want and She's accused seven other men of kidnapping that's the case against me so I have enough faith and Justice that
it's all going to be put away pretty quickly but um yeah I wish those old videos didn't exist but much more than
those I'm far more embarrassed about old videos I made that were anti-god I feel genuinely bad about those much worse
than that so it's just like I'm not what you're selling to kids today absolutely not I'm doing the absolute opposite I'm
trying to push children towards religion I'm trying to push kids towards God and it's amazing that
I it's amazing that I'm being attacked with these videos I'm embarrassed by them that's fine but I'm glad my atheistic videos didn't appear I'd be
far more embarrassed I'd feel genuinely shameful to watch those but you know we're human and we make mistakes and all
we can do is grow like you said trust me I went through the conservative ringer too the suddenly
all sorts of things I mean they hit me with uh old anti-bullying company that I was trying to put together based on
something that I lived through when I was in high school and they tried to say essentially that I was trying to dox people I still have to answer for a
splash page for an anti-bullying company that I tried to create with the most goodness in my heart and they still
throw it at me she's a fraud this is not what she actually thinks I mean I have to answer the conspiracy some things are
even crazy that George is some George's father or somehow related to the Rothschild and I mean it gets crazy and
the bigger that you the bigger your platform becomes the more they dig into your history and they'll dig into
ex-boyfriends I mean it never goes away but I I'm hardened to the process us I
am who I am I'm proud I actually am proud of a lot of the things that I lived through a lot of the mistakes that
I've made because it made me who I am today it's interesting you say hardened to the process because I think I am too because when I watch old content or mine
or things I wish I didn't do or say I will feel guilty or awful shameful or I'll feel embarrassment because of me I
don't care what people think I don't care if some conservative wants to watch a video and make a video that I don't I
don't care it's about me and my own personal morals and my own personal morality and how it's evolved and how I
feel about things I've done it's all about me it's internalized I don't care what these people say externally because I know that nobody's perfect and I also
stick by this and I've said it many times but I know absolutely not live to be true anybody who is attacking me if they've been under the level of forensic
assault I've been under would have far worse things out there in the public right sure right and I know that that one of the charges against you is that
you're materialistic you're describing that as peacocking and it's funny when I see you with Lamborghinis or whatever I
don't know anything about cars whatever the cars are I always think of I'm friends with a lot of UFC fighters and
and one of the ones that I have great respect for is Colby Covington oh yeah and it's so funny because I have my
podcast he's sort of this quiet guy super respectful just not at
all what you're getting in the ring and when we talked about that he said no one pay attention to my fights and then
suddenly I'm in Brazil I think I'm about to get dropped and I start talking a bunch of trash and suddenly he's got a huge audience behind him and this is
part of the the men like the bragging the Ben like the peacocking completely um and so I love it and that's why I say
when I see some of these videos and I see conservatives assigning like real meaning to you saying stuff that is just so obviously content for young boys the
only way I can describe it because it's just like a bunch of guys just being guys and the girl's respect this is so
stupid that's my reaction it's so stupid but I'm why are we trying to assign real meetings this is how guys have fun the
same way that girls sit around and talk about Real Housewives yeah absolutely it's bravado it's just it's girls are into my husband cannot do like five
seconds of hearing me and my girlfriends talk about things he's like I'm out yep and this is what woman Jimenez guys are
together and he's like they're fishing and the first catch you gotta bite the head I'm like that is so stupid so
ridiculous why do you are you biting a head off of a fish but it's just boys being boys and girls being girls
completely and so I think that people should not assign like I mean I've seen really stupid videos of you and they're
trying to really assess these videos as if this is like I'm like this is just
posting well yeah they're taking it now you see Colby he's got these hot girls in bikinis he's behind cars on his thing
and I think it's hilarious and I think it's funny because it's I get it it's for it's not for me and that's not for me and that's the thing actually which a
lot of conservatives and the conservative movement don't understand is that by attacking somebody for having a little bit of fun or for being Bravada
for having some bravado or saying something audacious or having a nice car whatever Bugatti whatever yeah if you're
gonna attack people for that you're just gonna drive young boys away from your message you need the Youth of a message for the message to exist and survive if
you're going to just be Mr boring and be upset by everything then nobody's gonna have any affiliation with it I really do
believe the reason liberals owned the culture for so long is because liberalism overall it looks it's not
because when you become spiritual you understand that it destroys your soul but it looks fun it does look fun it
looks fun because there's no rules and you can do a bunch of dumb stuff you can take drugs you can run around go to orgies and watch porn and sleep with all
these degenerate women and they're all promiscuous and it's a big party it looks fun and we talk about culture and how important it is to live win the
culture okay well then I come along and I'm largely conservative-minded and I have this massive fan base and then
you're gonna attack me into Andrew as a car that's bad well they're like is that the fight you want is that how you're
going to win this culture War very much separate myself from the conservatives that do that I'm like this is on my show I'll show clip I'm like I can't believe
this is even being passed around as something that should be taken seriously it's so stupid it's so ridiculous it's so obviously content for guys this is
what I imagine if my husband left to his own devices and he's around all of his Lads in the UK I mean the subject was
just so stupid but then he thinks the same thing about me when I'm with all my girls it's so stupid completely and we do need to stop being so severe okay
it's materialism okay we get all I get what you're trying to say but also this is just fun content for guys but then let's also talk about the materialism
thing right because it's interesting to me that can services will sit and say all materialism is bad or it's anti-christian Etc and I understand
where there might be a point to argue there but I tell you something if you're completely and utterly broke then you need the government to eat then you're
in a lot of trouble we talk about the Matrix and resist in The Matrix one of the tools to doing that is Financial Freedom and this is one of the Baseline
realities of it I'm not saying you should sell your soul for money absolutely not really not but if you want to truly resist the Matrix as a
whole you need to have money to do it it's pretty hard to do when you're broke even me as a person if I had no money
the current situation I'm in would absolutely not really destroy me I would be completely and utterly wrecked like how could I pay my bills I've taken 15
million dollars of my money I'm locked in my house so you need to have a degree of Financial Freedom otherwise you're going to end up just doing what you have
to do to eat you look at these people in England there was a video that recently was on Twitter I felt really sad when I
saw it it was a Workman taking down the British flag and putting up the pride flag and someone shouted at him hey bro you're moving you're removing the wrong
flag and he goes I know mate I know you're taking the wrong flag down mate
at least you know that
but he had to pay the bills he has to feed his family what can he do he's a flag hole he's a flag hanger all he can do is hang the flags if he doesn't do it
someone else will do it he loses his job so if you're completely and utterly reliant on a wage or you have no money well now you have a new tool of
enslavement covid was all based around that oh I just gotta go to work I just get the injection ah I Gotta Wear the
Mask I gotta fly I gotta work gotta work I'll work it takes a lot of money to sit down and say no I'm too principled that
takes money to do so it's also interesting the conservatives want to attack materialism okay perhaps I didn't have to buy a fancy car you can get
upset about that if you like but if you're not financially free it's also pretty difficult to stand up and tell
the truth even if you make a lot of money if you're reliant on let's say a sports team for a contract even if you
make a lot of money if you don't have enough saved you can't tell the truth even if you're rich they're all still complying and bending because they have
a contract they're adhering to it's difficult so I don't think that if you had somebody who was trying to inspire
the masculine Youth Of Tomorrow to resist the slave mind teaching them to be financially free would be a bad thing
I think it would actually be a good thing I think men need it because they think view it as aspirational and no one escapes it I would definitely not
describe my husband as materialistic at all he likes cars there's just something about cars that men like my son truck
truck carp it's like it's psychotic I mean it's such a boy every time he sees a truck a Car Any car that looks cool
he's two yeah he's two so there is something ingrained in men that completely his first word was truck you
know every time a garbage truck goes by anything he's just like a school bus men like that for whatever boys like that
men like that it's us I don't think we need to overthink it yeah absolutely it's aspirational but also so if we're
going to actually look at the meta point I believe that teaching Financial Freedom I think teaching Financial Freedom is one of the very important
ways you teach people to resist a slave mind I don't think you can resist the slave mind if you're completely nutly broke on welfare or living paycheck to
paycheck for a large Corp which is insistent on trying to install the slave programming inside of your head I think it's very very difficult I actually
think Financial Freedom is a key component to it and I think that me standing up and showing a life that costs 50 million dollars a year or
something ridiculous doing that on purpose and trying to inspire men to make as much money as possible is actually a very key component to the
resistance of the slave mind I don't think many people understand this because if you teach young men how to go out there and become rich as possible
it's very difficult they can do that without learning some degree of mental fortitude without learning how to speak to people without learning how to
network without learning how to be competent and disciplined and motivated and work hard and then they do all that they have enough money so that when
someone comes along and says take this injection they'll say no I don't want to take the injection I'd rather miss the flight so there is a key component of
resistance without which actually involves materialism I'll argue that if I was exactly the same person with the
same viewpoints but I was completely hardly flat broke I wouldn't be able to make the same impact on the world and I wouldn't be able to resist the
programming the same because I need to eat food so I'd actually count or argue any conservative who's complaining about
my beautiful car collection of 42 not one 42 nice cars that having a lot of
money is actually an important way to resist the Matrix I can only talk from personal experience but the number of
times especially during covet for example where I managed to not have to comply with neither laws simply because I was loaded it was I can't even name
one like 10 hands so materialism is important I think we should be teaching
especially the young boys especially people who understand who want to live in a very rational World want to live in a world which is based on common sense
and dignity and honor and respect and all the things we're trying to teach through conservatism is that if they don't have a degree of financial
stability or financial Independence they're going to end up getting wrecked anyway they're going to work for woke Corp and woke Corp is going to change
its Twitter picture or X picture whatever it's called now to a pride flag and they're going to be screwed anyway so you have to be teaching to a degree
Financial Independence I don't know why that scene is a bad thing I'd actually really like to argue that point with who was complaining about my car
one of my 42 cars I think it was a packaged you know this video and kind of
showing that you're not actually good for young men and they wonder why and they wonder why they lose the culture War imagine sitting there telling young
men don't have a nice car like him don't be fun like him don't do that like what
plan are you people on no one doesn't have a sense of humor like I think Colby Covington's Instagram is hilarious completely I know this is not how he
lives like we first off to be an MMA fighter his whole life is Diet extra I mean he's feeding his body every day he
doesn't really have time to be going to the strip club and you know but I I get the brand I think it's hysterical he's
actually a really wonderful human being and I'm I'm happy that I'm not so serious that I don't see the humor in
this and that and boys love it they do they do love it it's and I wonder if these people really don't see the humor
or if they're just so desperate to find an attack Vector that's going to get upset I think that's a good question I
think but I will actually I want to get to what your belief in is in terms of when you start talking about the Matrix
because I will say I some of the people that have been going after you Liz wheeler obviously has been one of them
um Liz wheeler hasn't wanted I think you blocked her um Ali stuck he has talked a lot about it I know these young women they're not
a part of the Matrix okay I have a lot of disagreements with them stylistically we have disagreements Ali's a is a means
what she says even if I disagree with her point I know she means she said it's not an act for her she's not trying to do anything she says it because she
believes it and learn for a year she's actually been very good to me when people were very the the guard of
conservatism Ali had me on her show she had a platform for me Liz genuinely believes everything that she's saying I
don't think she's a part of the Matrix even if I think that there are some pieces of it of your life and why people
gravitate towards you that she doesn't fully understand and maybe she never will understand it but they to me are
not a part of the Matrix okay so so let's talk about what the Matrix is and what the Matrix isn't sure let's talk
about the Matrix before we that before we do that let's talk about this recent conservative attack I want to make it clear that I don't
watch basically any of the attack videos made on me I'm I'm busy and I'm very
happy with my life and I don't allow attacks on my psyche if somebody makes a video that attacks me
I don't watch it I don't watch it because I don't want to watch it because I don't care I don't watch him either I don't care and I don't say this to
insult Liz or anyone else I don't know them enough or respect them enough to give what they made or what they say I
don't care so I can't talk about the specifics of what she said because I don't know what she said because I didn't watch it
however I don't believe it was well intentioned
I think that there is certainly a degree of jealousy that came with my massive influence in the number of views I've
gotten the Tucker Carlson show I think the fact that 10 year old videos which have been debunked 30 times
are now coming up again is not well intentioned at all but
I can't be entirely sure of that so I can't comment specifically on their attacks because I haven't watched their
attacks I don't I think they're seeing those videos for the first time that's why I said I'm trying to bridge the gap between I ain't only about those videos
for a long time because I've been paying attention to your UK career I don't believe these people have been I think
the first time they were introduced to you was on Tucker Carlson's interview if I'm guessing I have not spoken to them but I'm so they're just seeing this then
somebody starts circulating old clips and they are like oh my God this person this must be true again guessing have
not spoken to them about you at all got it well it's up to them to come to their own conclusions about me I'll live my life and I'll continue to live my
fantastic life and I'll be the best person I can be and they can come to their own conclusions they can make videos in support of me or attacking me
for the rest of human time I'm not gonna watch any of it I'm not interested so that's those two but um in regards to the Matrix as a whole The Matrix I
believe and I use the term The Matrix from the movie because I think it perfectly describes the world we're in today I believe we're living in a false
reality which is projected inside of our minds and it's designed to distract us long enough for our bodies to be abused and the movies from body heat in the
real world perhaps for or some physical labor but I believe that we're not living in a real version of reality I believe there are Gatekeepers on the
truth the agents who try their very best to keep us asleep and I think the end goal is to keep us distracted long
enough for our body to be utilized and then for us to die who is the Matrix and what is the matrix's all I have to be very careful
what I say and I don't want to get in too much trouble but I think anybody who is perspicacious enough to understand
how the world Works understands that the media machine is trying very hard to keep us Convent to keep us convinced of
certain ideas and also to keep us arguing about very unimportant ideas so people behind the media machine who decide what goes on the news can do
whatever they want to do and those the things they do usually have dire consequences to all of our lives so I
would say that the Matrix as a whole is the media machine from the projection point of view and the people who control
the media try very hard to make sure they have ultimate control over all governments and all important decisions
on the planet I agree I totally agree welcome to the conspiracy welcome to the
conspiracy the listen to my podcast I'm in on like CIA documents showing people this is not it's not a conspiracy theory
these are Declassified CIA documents these are things that they actually did and that nobody pays attention to because it happened 60 years ago but
it's been Declassified you know all the operations that they had putting actual journalists under CIA pay I mean it's
crazy following the death of JFK why do they do that why do they suddenly feel it was necessary to have journalists on payroll following the death of a
President Who there are a lot of questions surrounding his death so you're You've Got the Right audience with me when in terms of that I think I
think the media is the enemy of the American people that is why I I liked Trump calling that out right away talking about fake news what I don't
understand is why anybody listens to anything they say I know it is because they've been
caught lying so many times is it just because they lie on repeat over and over
again to the point where people just accept it is it because it's cowardice and accepting that these people constantly lie to you makes you adopt a
worldview which is scary because you have to not think for yourself I'm not sure what it is but how after especially
the last five to six years especially the last five to six years can you believe a word these people say to you
well because if they say it enough it becomes true and that's been they've been able to show that that if you say something over and over again to someone
they will accept it as a truth and that was another uh Declassified CIA experiment was super interesting they
put a bunch of people in the room so let's say there's too many people in the room right and 19 of them are agents and one of them is actually the person
they're testing and they show you a picture of what is clearly a banana and they go around them the last person they
get to is the one that's the the experiments on everyone else is an agent and they say what is this and the first person says apple apple is clearly a
banana by the time they get to that 19th person who is not an agent that person just says it's an it's an apple even
though it's clearly they don't even believe their own eyes anymore because they're going okay well if 18 people in this room have said that it's an apple what do you see an apple apple then they
just say apple so there's a lot of evidence they do it because it works and and everything around us shows you it works we're right now debating whether
or not you know children can pick their gender how did we get here this is this is something we couldn't even fathom when we were in high school that people
would be saying like your little boy could be a little girl but we're here today and actual adults are believing this information because it's been said
enough times to whatever segment of the population that they're accepting it as true so they do it because it's been
effective and that's why God is so important because God is a hard line that you cannot be crossed right that's why you will not be libertarian that's
why I'll not be libertarian not be libertarian no but if you have if yeah it's true because if you have faith then
there's Rights and Wrongs like you said earlier there's sin and there's good and there's a line that can't be crossed and the psyop is very difficult to penetrate
and that's why in the Islamic world for example we have very little of these problems because it's Haram
it's problem solved or wrong next but um yeah it's it's it's it's certainly scary
and I don't think people understand how
evil absolute power will make a person I don't think people understand how Petty
and how vindictive and how degenerate absolute power will make people I think
there's a degree of naivete in the population when you talk about the Matrix and the people who are behind the media and they believe these people
might be powerful people or rich people well not necessarily bad people but unfortunately I don't think they
really truly understand the reality I had a theory that I was arguing with somebody with
and I keep using kovic this is a perfect example of the psyop everybody who once believed in covid now no longer believes
mostly all of them which I find actually remarkable because when I talk about covet now in front of 20 people everyone's like yeah man that was
garbage but during covid I couldn't find a single person who wouldn't wear the mask I was like oh I'm by myself I got
arrested in Germany I mean Tristan got arrested sir out of my math squares handcuffs I'm like what the and I guarantee if I was standing in front of
those people now that I'll be like yeah kovid was stupid it's amazing how people want to flip and forget reality so I use
covid because people were fully psyops and now they're not psyopted I'm trying to wake you people up to understand something about how garbage it all is
I'm trying my very best to make people understand that the people who make the news have no interest in you being informed why would they make the news
and broadcast it to you everywhere for you little Mr Nobody to understand how the world works why would they care
about you knowing anything that's important ever do we not a slave if you if you're knowledgeable and that's why I always say go back to when we had
physical slavery in America a requirement to maintain that was ensuring that slaves didn't learn how to
read that was part of the slave code they weren't allowed to learn how to read if you were caught teaching a Slave how to read you you too as a master
would would be fall victim right and that it was so important for them because they know that an educated mind
can't be enslaved so the goal of the mainstream media is to keep people stupid and it is why I think that
despite the fact that you admittedly say that you are not a conservative and despite the fact that I don't think you're overtly political none of that
really matters I think what matters now is what you will do with the platform that you have completely impact you will
have completely and inspiring people to free think and to not believe all the slave programming which is told to them
and to not just follow lockstep with the lies that are given to them I think in
and of itself makes you a conservative and to a degree makes you political unfortunately now that's how the Divide
exists if you're teaching people to think for themselves and be strong people of agency and self-respect then you're going to be on one side of the
political spectrum and if you're teaching people to be the absolute opposite you're gonna be on the other side and by extension I guess I am
political and I am conservative just because I'm telling men to stand up and to be strong and to think for themselves and that makes you resist to slave
programming and I like to believe that the conservatives themselves of resisted slave programming the most
um but yeah it's it's a scary world we're allow living in we're things that I'm saying which were basically
completely accepted by the entire population 15 years ago or enough to make me the most hated man in the world but isn't that crazy I think the things
I'm saying are things that were widely accepted for a very long period of human time I think that things are still widely accepted in most of the world
today I think it's the decadence of the West that allow us to pretend these ideas and these realities don't exist
and I don't know how long we're going to last under this false reality I don't know how long Society can possibly
function with the insanity that they're trying to purport on the population of the West the fact that so many calories
in the Western World genuine calories from food and human time is wasted discussing pronouns and trying to get
somebody's pronouns correct in a sentence that they've made up which change at random think of the absolute
Insanity of that and how long can a society actually function with that degree of decadence and absolute asinine
Behavior I don't know how long we can even function anymore I think the West is in a lot of trouble and
it's almost like especially certain talking points and I find myself guilty of it as well we talk about certain
talking points which are pushed to the front and I kind of feel like they are a mass distraction they have to be because
they're so ridiculous but the problem is people there's a certain percentage of
the population that genuinely believe them I would love to live in a world where they try and push the idea that a man is a woman or that a man can change
to a woman and then compete in women's sports without an advantage I would love for them to try and push that idea and
for everybody to go this is stupid next no but because some people believe we
have to now waste our time discussing and debunking the most obvious hello
Warriors wet good to see here and talk about the sky being blue for days and weeks and years almost at a time talk
about the ultimate distraction tool by The Matrix for them to sit there and go you know what let's come up with some
absolute garbage and let's throw it to the front and the smart people will fight against it but enough dummies will
disagree with it and that'll keep them distracted while we do something that matters and we find my I even myself falling victim for it because it's so
necessary because a certain subsect of the population is so dumb that they believe it if people were all just a
little bit less receptive to display programming everyone would stand up and say no you're gonna try harder than that next and we could discuss something that
actually matters and this is the point I was going to say earlier about coven so covid
I think a lot of people do not understand how Petty and vindictive power can genuinely make somebody and I
had an argument with a friend of my brother about two or three years ago during coven when you had to wear a mask
when you went in the restaurant and then you sat down you took it off and then you ate and you put it back on to go to
the toilet you took it off and I said I hope you understand there are someone somewhere some billionaire on a yacht
who is doing this as a compliance exercise as a joke I know as a joke and
he goes why would you do all that just for a joke because if you're in charge of the entire world and you have unlimited money what's going to make you
happier Ferrari you've had Ferraris your whole life boring all that you care about is power compliance it's all funny
to you it's vindictive it's Petty why not you're in charge for the same reason if you're in charge of a big company
you're like you know I want you all in at 8 45 tomorrow why not it's a power play ego status respect all things were
talking about earlier these people are born into massive influence money doesn't make them uh feel powerful
they've never worked for anything in their lives now they have a little bit of control over you they're going to make you do something so they can laugh
at you I'm telling you it was a joke I say I say the same thing I'm like there's no way they're not just playing like Simon says to see if we can they
can actually make people abide by these things and people keep actually abiding by them there's no way that they're not sitting back laughing it's a joke they
must be laughing because it's it's so Preposterous and people don't understand that there are people in the world who
have power who are literally vindictive enough to just mess with the entire populace for a joke and I don't think
people understand when you look at the Matrix as a whole and yeah you talk about the media machine and how it's trying to push these ideas on you and
the people behind it the people are behind it do not have any kind of genuine intention their intentions are absolutely not least selfish they want
to feel good and feel powerful no matter what it takes
[Music] thank you
[Music] kind of evil and scary that these people have a world view which is so logically
flawed it's so devoid of genuine rationale that they have to go to the
most susceptible subsect of the population to inject it which is why you should get married because the guard
against that is strong families is it it is a nuclear family it is a mom and a dad sitting around the dinner table
saying what did you learn at school say it's Mom guarding at home going through their homework and seeing what they're
learning and saying absolutely not and it's Dad going to work building and that nuclear family is the only guard against
handing over your children to the government which is why in the next five years I just think you should get
married the only guard except Islam No I don't have to worry about my children's homework thank you very much it's all
handled by God and it's interesting you said that though it is a good point and I think Matt Walsh actually says
something about me having uh I have children from a few different women I don't like to give details on it but uh so does Elon Musk
and I do think although this may be elitist I will state here that a certain level of Finance is not the same crime
as it would be if I was a traditionally financed individual I can afford two or
three families and I can afford to see them all and I can afford to go to three countries in a single day on my jet if I need to and I'm a very good father to
all my children I love them very much and you're right I completely agree with you the nuclear family is the answer my solution is not the solution for
everyone but the nuclear fancy family is the answer I agree with you but uh Islam is also an answer
well I don't know enough about the Islamic faith to be able to counter you on that point but I do think that having
all your children around the dinner table brother sister right this is beautiful it's beautiful of course I want that for you of course it's style
that's beautiful as well the Canadians podcast is supported by Grand Canyon University an affordable private

have to we talk about Darwinism I'll ask you another question because I'm very interested
do you think abortion is Darwinism it's an argument that can be made right
killing off your own offspring it means that you're you're not putting your Offspring into like these people with
the sign yeah I killed 10 of my kids is isn't that I mean it's evil it's satanic
it shouldn't happen I'm not saying that it's a good thing I'm just asking is there a darwinistic element to all of
this that when I look at that the Earth will be populated with conservatives because their ideas I mean my husband
always says the left is a death cult if you look at all of their ideas they lead to death right you can't procreate
you're killing off your own offspring every single one of their ideas leads to death and destruction it's unbelievable
so in the end you'd have to have the perspective that conservatives went naturally because we're talking about if
we own the culture yeah but we don't so what they're doing is they're they're accusing the culture to sigh off enough
young children who are not living a traditionalistic life like you're saying or not having a strong family nuclear
family to keep them against the slave programming and they're using them to create the new generation of death cultists to continue to keep Humanity
under attack but I don't know I I really struggle as a person I try my very best to my father
had a saying which I use I allow manipulation to find out where my enemy wants me to go and then I use my mind to
break the Trap and punish the perpetrator and the reason he said that was because if you don't allow them to manipulate you you don't know exactly
where they want you to go if they try to manipulate you and you absolutely not only resist you might end up taking another path towards the same
destinations you should allow them to manipulate you watch the slave programming watch the propaganda watch all of it find out what you want then
what they want you to believe and then you can use your mind to instantly break the Trap I did it in covet and when I first watched Kovu when I watched the
Italian hospitals and people falling over in China at the very very beginning of it I sat there and thought what do they want me to believe they want to be
scared of this disease they want me to be afraid no I'm not going to be afraid so if I'm Not Afraid what's the answer
well the answer is to go to which country Sweden's open nobody talks about the fact that Sweden was open the whole time never closed ever I'm interested in
nightclubs the entire time people were locking their houses nobody talks about this it's like no one mentions it anymore but you have to use your mind to
break the Trap and I feel like I've tried to allow my mind to be silked
into this transgender stuff or this abortion stuff and even I can't even pretend to buy into it I can't see how
you can reach that level of delusion and that's where I say maybe it must be Darwinism because maybe even with all of
my mental capacity I can't even pretend to be stupid enough to want to go and chop my genitalia off to then imitate a
woman poorly imitate a woman for the rest of my human years that literally sounds like a form of torture that
sounds like one of the worst existences ever I feel sorry for anyone who's fallen for that because they're never
going to be what they want to be ever it's it's just like the worst possible existence I just can't think of anything
possibly worse and I don't know maybe there's a darwinistic element to all of these things we can just control the
culture and make sure that no future children are Psy opt into the death cult maybe it should all fall apart because people who truly are that susceptible
me and my brother have a joke in the house there's flies and mosquitoes in the house sometimes every time one of us
kills a fly we say you've improved the gene pool because the slow one got killed the fast
one he doesn't get killed so the fast One's Gonna be here forever I want to think about that every time I kill a
flyer if you kill a fly you're helping them get quicker if you didn't if we didn't kill flies all these millions of
years they would never be so elusive I don't know maybe if there's a darwinistic maybe I'm just trying to feel better about this yeah maybe
there's they're they're so evil they've decided we're going to kill off all of the people that are stupid I I don't know and then we'll be left
with just strong independent but then they can't control the strong independent people so then you kind of you got you got a bit of a problem there
I've got another question for you how polarized do you think the world is do you think there's two teams do you think globalists control everything do you
think there's three or four teams what do you think about that I think it's probably now divided into two teams yeah
yeah because now you have to find more in common it's like how crazy are you we may have been divided into four five six but now it's like do you believe that
children should chop it off right or yes yes or no Circle yes or no yeah right that's where we're at because you have
to be so far deluded to believe this and if you're just in some realm of Sanity we probably have enough in common that
we should fight together right just because like they're going out for the kids no it's like and I think that is really where we got divided into two
categories where it's like you're either Pro going after the children or you're against going out for the children and it's remarkable how many people are pro
letting them go after the children it's it's it's kind of scary but that's where I think it's now pretty much two camps
it used to be more I think so also and then within new obviously there's little battles and and to me they're Meeting
Lists I think maybe I'm saying that because I'm a mom and now so there's nothing more important to me than protecting children and worrying about
what my children are going to face I'm going to be the crazy mom when my kids are at school I will be there every single day looking over every amazing
every assignment amazing leaning fully into the feminine role of like yeah so I but I do think now it's come down to two
camps it's crazy and not crazy I wonder what the future of the world is Candice I feel like I know everything and I talk like I know everything but
I'm actually starting to think things are getting your dad might have had an idea yeah I wish he was still around but things are starting to get very very
strange and yeah and I I guess also when we're talking about me my libertarianism versus conservatism
I never like I would never allow my child to be aboard ever I do think
it's heinous and disgusting but I will be honest with you when I see people trying that hard to kill their kids I'm
kind of like I'm not gonna lie I maybe that's the libertarianism In Me Maybe I don't know
but I'm just like there's got to be a darwinistic element to some of these things I don't think they should happen I would love to stop them all I believe
that all life is precious I think it's heinous I don't think that anyone should chop off any of their body parts either but it does get to a point where it's
just like if you're that desperate to damage your own life and damage yourself
am I the person who's gonna fight for you I don't know police women are broken and they're brainwashed and I like to think
that if they hear the right message something in the same way that I think a lot of broken men heard you say
something and it woke something up inside of them true I think that they can land on my message and they can hear
it and go wait a second that thing that was killed inside of me systematically from the school system and made me think
that what it meant to be a woman was to be a because that's kind of the message that's going out right now 100
to be a and hate children which is the opposite of what it means to be a woman then when they hear something and
I talk about how aspirational family is and something is or how much I love being a mother and and then I think
inside of them this something spiritual happens or they go wait a second I think that's actually what I am I've been
conditioned to believe I'm this but actually this is what I am so I'm I'm more hopeful that the more that we have
better pillars in society that we have people speaking out on the opposite messaging that Hollywood is bringing on
the on the glory of being a woman on the beautiful of the beginning gang on that submission in a marriage is not a bad
thing actually it's a beautiful thing I agree and these messages have been perverted that where we make a
difference and I think we we know we're winning no we are now they want censorship now they want the people taking off the internet now they want
this person to go down and that they weren't doing that when they were winning they didn't care we were allowed
everybody was allowed to have a platform when Obama was President completely true we are winning and I just think it's an
unfortunate of the human condition that people don't really like to learn lessons the easy way they have to learn them the very hard way and it's very
difficult for us to sometimes sit and tell people the truth and even and they just don't want to learn it until it's too late I like to think that these
women who hold up these I lost 10 babies I killed 10 baby signs will one day wake up and feel very sad about what they've
done and they will do and it's possible and it's possible and I think even time will show them God will show them with
time I don't know how I'd talk someone out of the transgender argument like how would you convince someone who is 100 certain
they want to mutilate their body to not mutilate their body I don't that's a scary one to me because their mind and that's also one that you can't really
undo which I think is sad which is why the suicide rates go up after transitioning I think is once you do it
you've committed but I've seen I've sat down with a man that did that had the full surgery his name is Walt heyer and
he's is dedicated the rest of his life to waking up other uh that's the most noble thing you can do yeah he's like
you know this is what I did this is how I was convinced it's how I was brainwashed this is what happened to me I was actually just molested when I was
a kid and I just wanted to get rid of my identity in any capacity so I did the most extreme thing that I could possibly do I platform those individuals and I
think that he's he runs a not-for-profit now which you know sex change regret there's many people that are like him out there and yeah it's gonna take God
it's going to take spiritualism and it's going to take repurposing your entire life after you do something that extreme hopefully just us having this
conversation prevents people from making those sorts of very serious decisions and
you know but this is why YouTube will try to censor this conversation okay I mean that's the whole point is my face my face is on it you're in trouble so
I'm gonna ask you a few more questions if you don't mind my face is troubled too I would just like to State yeah of course of course it is why do you think
marriage has reduced in the Western World why do you think less people are getting married than before conditioning it's all about social
conditioning and it's about uh the feminist messaging going back to our conversation about the matriarchy they've totally conditioned women to
believe that marriage is a trap that you are going to be unhappy that you are going to be sacrificing your freedom
when in reality I got more freedom than I ever had when I became married because I finally became a secure woman I knew
what my purpose in life was when I had children everything else is so stupid and meaningless how could you think you were going to find your purpose in the
bottom of a Red Bull vodka at one Oak canvas you know what I mean how could you think that well because that's what
that's what Hollywood told me that's what I saw on MTV and I thought that was all aspiration I look at those women I
think they're miserable I look at these people that women that are still finding their freedom I say find the number one
feminist that you know and ask yourself a question do you think she's happy completely chasing her career do you think Chelsea Handler's happy never
right and the answer is no and so I'm I'm lucky that I got that wake-up call I'm blessed that I got married I'm
blessed that I have you know three children album with on the way and the more that I can talk about how happy and
fulfilled I am for the first time in my life right not when I was drinking and pretending to be happy but for the first time I actually am happy and I got those
things by finally realizing that the message that those things are going to constrain me was utterly false and was
meant to put me down a path of misery do you think why do you think men are not getting married that's women do you
think men have something to do with it same thing I think well first and foremost I think and I speak out on this women are not desirable right now
everyone's Kim Kardashian clone I asked you earlier what don't men want and you said promiscuity well that seems about
the only thing that's being offered right now but my Instagram and I've got butt
cheeks and I'm going people like I don't understand why no one wants to This Woman's been married four times I'm like well I can I can understand it because
even if men think they want it in the short term when you see a girl she's half naked she looks good yeah sure you
probably do want to have sex with her I bet you're wired that way you're hardwired that way but then what happens after you after you have sex though and
you realize that so did up 20 other dudes in the same week you don't want her you nailed it you're absolutely
nailed it and this is where it's so we're in such a difficult it's a race to the bottom between the two genders yeah
as the women act worse the men act worse by extension because if you're going to be moral in an immoral world you're
going to end up wrecked right so it's getting harder and harder so we have to kind of like fix one of the genders first women women aren't desirable right
now as in the Western Hemisphere as a whole um and of course finding a wife is hard
finding a wife is hard and it's because women are literally being conditioned to behave like completely and they're
also being conditioned to leave the man as soon as things get difficult there's a lot of programming in this I don't
think even many people pick up on but women are conditioned to act a certain way before marriage but also during marriage men and women are conditioned
differently if you have a man who's been married for 10 or 15 years and let's say he doesn't sleep with his woman anymore
and he goes on TV and says me my woman have been married 15 years we no longer have sex I'm not satisfied I should
leave everyone will say to him no you can't leave you can't leave or just because you want to have sex with you are you out your mind are you crazy
stick by your woman she has an emotional problem Etc if you had a woman who said I've been married for 15 years I've been
with him I'm not attracted anymore I don't have sex with him anymore you deserve Freedom you can go get someone else why are you putting up with this
his his feelings aren't your responsibility so it's actually very interesting also the psyop happens post marriage women are also attacked
post-marriage to not try not stick around not worry about their husband's age speaking to your point one thing I speak to the young women that follow me
about is making an effort after you get married this idea I was reading this ridiculous column ask Jane where a guy
was writing in or in Earnest saying you know I love my wife she's a wonderful mother to our children we've been
married she had one child two two years later she gained 50 pounds and hasn't lost it and the Jane wrote back to him
and yelled at him for saying he's like he's like I'm not attracted to her anymore I don't want to just yelled at him for even saying this I'm going no
this is the why are you yelling at him for being honest the idea that marriage is a Finish Line is problematic that oh
well I got the guy I pretended I like to work out and go to the gym and now that I've got him I'm going to gain 200 pounds and he's just stuck with me that
is a poisonous mentality you should make an effort for your husband part of that's part of marriage is caring about
each other caring about each other's health health is wealth so it's even that is toxicity to say to a woman well
to say to a man you just have to like her anyways if she's 300 pounds and doesn't care anymore and sits on the couch all day that that's not what
marriage is really about completely agree and I think everything in life is rented I don't think anything is ever owned I think that your health is rented
and you have to pay the rent every day and your marriage is rented and you have to work on a marriage every day and your business is rented and everything you
have is rented I think the idea that even owning anything or anything is a Finish Line is wrong you don't just start a company and go okay I'm rich now
no you gotta work on that company every day it's rented you don't just get in shape and go I'm in shape now it's done no absolutely everything's the same in a
relationship is exactly the same and I completely agree with you I think that the breakdown of the nuclear family and
the breakdown of marriage in the west is actually one of the ills one of the big problems with that I I'm not married myself so I'm not
being completely I don't want to come across as hypocritical but I do think
that is actually a fast way to a degree to solve Society a lot of problems in society I do think though in the current
setup of society I think the reason a lot of men are also rejecting marriage is one because there's not many wives to
find but two I think a lot of men find themselves very unhappy in marriage because the women
have no interest at all and satisfied them like you said there are no interest on in their needs and they end up scared
of divorcing her because they're going to be bankrupt in a marriage where they don't feel respected kids don't listen
to them and they're not the king of their own household so what would be the attraction and getting married unless
you're gonna be the king of your own household and that can be extrapolated and discussed in two different ways one about feminine uh submissiveness but
also in about masculine accountability and Excellence because I think if you're truly an excellent man you can be the king of any household so it's very
interesting it's kind of interesting how all arguments come back to almost the same base biological things and you
teach women to be good women you teach men to be good men and everything kind of works out after that and if you break those two things everything built on top
of it completely degrades and breaks down because even all the other things we've discussed we discussed how
masculinity would have prevented a lot of the covert crisis we can talk about how genuine masculinity or a good nuclear family and anti-propagandist uh
dinner table can prevent a lot of this transgender Insanity there's a homemade
so many things can be fixed with a man being a man and a woman being a woman it's like the ultimate cure what I
always say and it's so natural to finding the rules in the household so like maybe hasn't had to sit down and it just was I had a natural proclivity to
do certain things I always give the greatest example when a baby is born the men don't know what to do for the first you just need your girls you know they
they just are what do I do and I remember like every thinking about every
diaper size transitioning what clothes he needed what onesies all of the stuff George not there we're not there I think
Georgie must have been that's my son's name Georgie must have been two months old and I said something to I don't
remember what I said to George but I had realized that George had already opened his college account truck like things
that I when I tell you my brain was no I was just like where are you where I'm
sitting here thinking about the day-to-day he's thinking about his future 100 I don't even know when I would have I think still to this day
George is not two and a half I still would not have opened an account for him it just is not where my brain was 100 and so I just I love telling my story
because it just speaks to how different I'm like did you try to feed him he's like I don't know why he's crying I'm like have you tried giving him food and
then he's like oh I've already sorted out this has been counted at us when he turns 18 so I'm like where are you men and women are different it's beautiful
those differences are beautiful the sexual sex differences are a beautiful thing our our instincts are beautiful
and we need to stop shunning them in this Society I love being a woman I love that my husband's a man we shouldn't be
making someone feel badly about being a woman we shouldn't make someone feel badly about being a man well absolutely and I if if I had to be pessimistic
about why they're doing it pessimistic and also very realistic they want to cause absolute Chaos on confusion
because they're in chaos and confusion you can Implement anything of course slavery it's slavery right people will
give up their freedom for only one thing and that's safety so they have to inject chaos and they have to inject confusion
and they want us confused at every level at every base level they want you confused they want you confused about
why your kid doesn't listen to you why your marriage doesn't work why you're broke why they want you confused from
the ground all the way up so you're just confused so when they come along with some sort of solution no matter what garbage it is you end up just adopting
it because you're sick and you need a medicine so absolutely they attack masculinity and femininity because it
works so perfectly together and if they can break that they can break all of society by extension and I think they've done a pretty good job of doing exactly
that and it's amazing if you look at these ideas we discuss and how ridiculous they are and how I feel like it's a psyop to even convince me to
waste my time convincing people that a man is not a woman it's done on purpose because they have
the world so confused now they can come at us with absolute garbage and it needs a discussion if we had the basis of
masculinity and femininity in the household how much harder would the transgender argument be to implement think about it well she's a woman I'm a
man no but now they know people thinking we're all the same it doesn't matter your gender is not real all this
craziness because of the breakdown of the basics so this is why perhaps they see you as such a threat and they see me
as such a threat and they see us as such a threat because we've just stuck to the age-old adages and the age-old ways that
people have always been and I do think that one of the reasons why they dislike me so much is because yeah I I certainly
live a teenage boy's dream but if you want to inspire the Next Generation how else are you going to do it right you
have to have the fancy car and the big yacht and all these things and and by inspiring these men to stand up and
think for themselves and resist the slave mind it's doing genuine damage to their slave agenda genuine damage to
their slave agenda and I think that that's why I especially ended up targeted I truly believe that's what's happening I think
there is an element of it that it's you you've captivated young men and that is a very important demographic in order to
sustain an enslaved population is you need to poison men and I think that that
is true so in closing other than the fact that we've agreed that you're going to get married in the next five years
sure I get four wives no not four wives just
one monogamous relationship okay what does Andrew Tate's life look like
in the next five years you've you've built your audience you did it with your
own Grant determination there are people following you I hope that if there's anything I leave you with it's that in
those moments when you're sitting across to Someone Like adam22 You Remember that there's the 12 year old and the 13 year
old boy that is going to be watching you and I think you did a good job by the way I think you said that you didn't like it and that was important enough
but what is what does the next five years look like for you yeah I want to do my absolute best I've I had someone
say to me the other day that I'm the richest man in the world and not because of my finances but because I actually have people whose lives I save and help
and I get a lot of people out there who genuinely feel a lot better because of me and I try my very best to tell the
truth and live true to my heart and I I live with my brother and I've got a lovely family and I feel like I've got everything almost ticked off and my
plans for the future are primarily to continue to tell the truth I think that we're now winning I think there's been a
pendulum that swung and people are tired of insanity and they're tired of being lied to I like the idea of young boys
who follow me just doing even one of the tenants I teach if you want to just work hard in the gym and become a fantastic
Financial physical condition or if you want to get financially secure which is one of the tenants I teach can genuinely improve people's lives I like the idea
of that and I want to have 10 Sons and I need to make sure that all 10 are
Andrew take four five six I'm the third seven eight nine all the way up and I have to make sure that the next
generation are being produced and they have to be strong enough to deal with the Romanian jail cell and deal with a matrix attack so it's going to be a very
difficult upbringing and I'm going to make sure that I'm very dedicated and focused on creating the next generation of super soldiers to resist enslavements
so my plans for the future are pretty simple I'm going to continue to tell the truth I'm going to live true to myself
true to God I really appreciate the audience he's given me and I know that I have a massive responsibility it makes me a better person I'm gonna be the best
person I know how to be and I'm going to have 10 Andrew Tates that's my goal that's the plan well you heard it here
first ladies and gentlemen if you thought one entertain was bad you've got 10 more coming at you in the near future
Andrew thank you so much for taking all this time such a good conversation thank you






yeah basically all the things you just said yeah four-time kickboxing world champion i guess i'll say i'm an entrepreneur multi-millionaire
all-around nice guy i agree around nice guy around my sky and yeah we're here in miami so
good to see you young lady good to me good to see you again it's always good to see you all right let's go into this because this is going to be totally
unfiltered i have a bunch of topics that i want to go into um for context we met about over a year
ago i think it was yeah we've known each other a while i've seen you out in the twitter space like taking over and flexing on them i've seen i've seen your
little videos like it's bitcoin going to go up or down da da and you do well and you're growing and that kind of thing so we've known each other a while yeah yeah
and ever since we met i've had a bunch of questions um and i'm not gonna filter and i'm not gonna filter anything no
sugar coat so i want to jump straight into this so you might so you might hurt my feelings that's what we're saying basically basically that's what's gonna
happen you see that people at home you see don't let this the pretty face fool you she's out here to break my heart hurt my
feelings so i've got to be careful here don't let the tough persona fool you all around nice guy all right let's jump
into this so one of the biggest things that you're known for is women and uh it's it's 9 30 in the morning
we're talking about chicks we're talking about chicks i'm happy today because look one of the first things that really confused me about you when we met was
the fact that you're not a one woman man okay that's not completely true
explain it's not completely true i'm not saying i couldn't have and enjoy the company of a single female for attorney
i'm saying my point is that truthfully if we remove all the garbage and the fairy tales if men are true to their
biology no man is completely utterly a one-woman man that's my point there's a societal expectation which has been
placed upon humanity and then we have a biological and evolutionary imperative and the male evolutionary imperative is
not to have one female now there are some dudes out there who are gonna disagree with me but those are dudes they got low testosterone they're not
the big g they got no money they ain't nothing right that's different but any man who's actually in a position of
status since the dawn of human time every single king every single sultan all of them had more than one chick
that's actually the natural human state so the point i was trying to make is even though i am a man of god and i try
and keep myself close to christ right because i'm such a because i'm such a nice guy
my point is any man who has the means to attract or solicit the company of
more than one female likely will enjoy this the company of more than one female does that make sense it doesn't i i respect it no
judgement the confusion that i have is your jet setting right you're here you're there
and we'll get to that but how does that work right because at the end of the day women want love emotion and attention and if you're
jet setting and if you have multiple women how how does that work practically i don't have any women it was just an
observation i don't have any women i'm like
i can't lie no um i know what you're saying women want love and they want attention those kind
of things and yeah i travel the world but i really don't think that it's difficult to uh maintain a relationship
purely based on if if if the connection is true then the
physical presence doesn't have to be as prevalent let's get it that way right there's lots of soldiers go to war and
they have a wife at home who loves them but that's different because they're going to die for a cause let's just i'm going to war i'm out here on the street
so you think i'm making all this money but what do you do but like you're not fighting about all i do is fight my life
is a fight what do you mean i'm not fighting a battle i'm fighting a battle against the oppression of humankind how are you doing that how am i doing that
i'm the only person who didn't cowered out at the beginning of this imaginary scam demo i'm out here literally
resisting the enslavement of man what do you think i'm trying to make all this money for more cars no i'm making money
specifically so that i am to a degree at least ungovernable i need to be you on it but that's on an
individual level and i take care of my people people why people so this is what i mean
it's not like i'm out here doing nothing i'm out here on the streets i gotta go miami i gotta see you go get this done
from here i gotta go dubai make some more money i'm running around the world i'm doing very very important things and if i had a female if i did because of
course i don't a man of god blah blah blah if i had a female she would have to be very understanding of the fact that i am a man of machine with a purpose and
you know some there are some missions should be allowed to come with me on and some missions she can't come it's not safe for females out here
i'm out here i'm all right i managed to get him next to me i got you i got you i got you leia you're okay but you know
but otherwise you've got to be careful women are you know what and i don't want to look like a misogynist
as usual misogyny is like is okay to a degree okay what
degree let me know give me a number at 10. i think it depends how we're defining misogyny right yeah like how do you
define misogyny realism realistic a lot of misogyny is just realism you
know like if you're a realist then to some degree you're going to be a sexist but is that sex so is that sexist or is
that just being real right because like if it's a fact yeah exactly is that sexy exactly so
i i personally i don't like traveling the world with women i think it's one of the most frustrating
things a man can possibly do okay imagine you had to travel around the world and you had to take a
three-year-old with you you'd be like where's my three-year-old how's it eight i have to make sure
they're safe gotta bring all their stuff it's exactly the same with the chick me and my brother we're spartan right we
can just go walk up at an airport oh there's no flight for 11 hours sleep in the airport terminal don't eat don't
sleep one bag on our back old school soldiers we don't care with a chick it's all i need food i need water where's my
stuff my case is 55 kilo oh i forgot this foundation i need to find this foundation it's it's horrible i do agree
with you but if i if i haven't eaten i'm not good yeah so women are effectively children
we're just different to men we're not children a child couldn't sit here and have this conversation with you
women have to be monitored and maintained and maintenanced effectively like a child would when it comes to not
like a child yeah same exactly the same it's the same it's interesting yeah like listen if i'm going to go to iraq
afghanistan all the places i've been to these places i go with tristan we're battle ready ak go off we start running like a chick
will all be standing there ah no that's true what would happen if you didn't have tristan
my life would be drastically different i think that all men in fact i'd say the actual plague of western nations today
is that all men lack a natural masculine support network i don't think it's just about me having my brother i think it's the fact that
most men out here don't have a genuine masculine support network they don't have men around them that they can
not so much confident but men hold other men accountable it's very easy to be brave when every man you talk to is
brave and it's very hard to be brave if none of the men you speak to a brave but what would you do if you didn't have tristan well then i'd have to get a
masculine support network outside of tristan which i've already done and created myself so it does exist but um
i don't think it would completely change who i am but certainly having my brother was important in my formulative years because if somebody like didn't like me
or something didn't like me it didn't matter because me and my brother we didn't care we're big we're hard to kill we don't doesn't matter if you like us right so one of the things i like about
you is that you didn't come from money correct and so you're very real
thank you as a compliment you are real thank you you did a video where you were like i'm out camping i don't need all the luxury
i don't need all this ambiance so um people don't know that so talk to me about that um growing up was it luton
you were born i know so i was born in washington dc oh america yeah and i left when i was nine and i grew up on a
council of state in lieutenant yeah council estate in louisiana yeah and from the ghetto
yeah that is the ghetto that is the the english ghetto so talk to me about that though what was that like and how long were you in in that kind of situation
yeah so i i left america when i was when i was around nine and i lived in luton until the age of
26 wow until you're 26 yeah a long time yeah but i was kickboxing right my fight
gym was there and i was fighting from there and before i finally managed to get out but i grew up in a council state in luton and i am so thankful for it the
best possible thing that can happen to somebody is to be born broke and become rich if you're born rich life's terrible
if you're born broke and you stay broke life's terrible but to be born broke and become rich is a beautiful thing because truthfully
money really isn't all that interesting what's interesting about money is thinking back to all the times you had no money i love
to go spend 25 000 for dinner not because the money twenty five thousand dollars for dinner all the
time yeah no yeah no but yeah all the time we're in miami where you been great places but i'm not putting down
25k for dinner because you're a chick and females don't pay anything for anything they don't in miami they don't pay anything yeah unbelievable but yeah
no women have to pay right but there's certain places you can definitely do that and the point is the food isn't worth it
and it's not worth 25 g's but the whole fun of it is just thinking back to when you never had 25 grand in your life i
never had any money in my savings account i was completely flat broke so it's the juxtaposition that makes it interesting there's no light without
dark so i love the fact that i was poor those are some of the in some ways they were some of the happiest times of my life life was simpler back when i was
poor i'm not going to buy into more money more problems i'm not going to say that being rich isn't fantastic because it certainly is however when you're
broke you have a very simple singular focus which is what it should be just to make more money but now my focus is more
spread out because i really i really do not need to make more money that's the one thing i do not need more of but there's so much more to this story
so i'm not gonna let that go so there was hardship right and your dad wasn't always around there was a story with
like the hair the whole haircut and you told your hair doesn't matter and all this like really
formed you yeah i want to hear about it i want to hear about the hardship okay
well the hardship my whole life was hardship and to some degree i try and make sure my life retains some degree of
hardship uh my my father was the og i was raised by probably the best father on earth i really genuinely but he wasn't around
but a father doesn't have to be around this is a big mistake this is another big mistake especially among the conservatives and the trad cons and all
this crap the idea that a father needs to sit around like a second mother to make a child healthy is a fallacy in
fact i'd say it's detrimental to the child i see all these dudes out here they have a kid and they basically become mother number two why the mother
keeps the child alive as a father it's your job to be impactful you need to guide you need to be a role model you
need to be a superhuman everyone should look at their father like a superhero that's what you should genuinely view him as it's hard to be a superhero of
your home every day arguing with your wife changing diapers that's not what man should do a man should rock up teach
lessons be impactful and it's more about quality as opposed to quantity of time i saw my dad once a month
he was out on the streets he was pimping hustling my father was a chess grandmaster he's traveling the world playing chess he had all his girls he's
doing whatever he's doing when he came home it was an impactful time whether it was a positive impact or a big argument
or whatever never was i ever around my father it was a low energy environment that's not who he was as an individual
and i remember every single second spent with him there's a whole bunch of dudes out here and chicks their father's home all the
time fine but if you're home all the time you're going to lose to a degree or mystery doesn't matter how cool you are
as individual you're home all the time always you're not going to have that magical power as opposed to whoa dad's
home i'm telling you the biggest mistake fathers make is that they let the woman convince them that to be a good dad they
need to be there all the time that is a complete lie fathers never did this we were always at war or down the coal
mines or away working this is the way it's always been for the for humanity right the men were away doing important
things now the man's at home changing diapers they're called punk why does that mystery matter of course
it matters because life is mystery life is a whole it doesn't mean anything that that's that's just a lot of um beautiful exciting words like life life is
absolutely mystery i'll tell you why the mystery matters because for a female to retain her attractiveness to a man there
has to be a degree of mystery that's the first thing so we're talking about household where even the woman truly
respects her man there's a bunch of dudes out here a bunch of people are married who are home every day low testosterone levels
they're cut out and they're going to disagree with me fine but it's the truth a woman is more attracted to a man who
gives a little bit of mystery let me give you an example let's imagine we're on a date uh lesser magic
and you asked me my job and i said oh i do this and this and this and this no no no what would you actually say you
wouldn't say this and this give me no i wouldn't i would never tell a female my job let's say what would you say let's say i run casinos i don't casino
right let's say so i picked you up we're in the lambo we go out for a nice
dinner i say i run casinos alternatively you say what's your job and i say
i look after my people that's my job
but the point i'm making is the story you're going to construct in your head is actually going to be more interesting
to you than the truth you're going to say what my man just 25 grand on dinner pulled up in a 400 000 car looks after
his people what does that even mean and it's going to be more interesting to you when you watch a horror movie
what what scares you is not the ghost that's on the screen it's the thing you don't see it's just walking and there's noise you
don't see anything and then bang it comes out of nowhere that's how human mind works a degree of mystery is extremely intriguing to the human mind
so it's extremely intriguing to the female for her man it's the first thing it's also extremely intriguing to the child for their father
dad's home oh no the whole dynamic of the house has changed everything's shifted dad is home he's been away and
now he's home whether it's positive or negative that has an impact on you has a genuine effect on your psyche i see so
many fathers walk in the house and the kids are just playing a video game dad walks in they don't give a [ __ ] is that is that
parenting are you a good dad now because you're home every day that's why all these dudes are pumps
no one can question what i'm saying when it comes to being a father or parenting because i was raised in a very specific way and i'm one of the greatest men on
the face of the planet so i know it works i'm the product of it right so if i had a son it would be my
duty to be out here traveling the world making money having impact being a fantastic individual that is the primary
focus of my existence as opposed to sitting there with my boy all day every day i can come home every two weeks with
a story boom and he'll be like that's the boss like yes dad is the boss is that
a minimum or like a maximum so for example you said just come home every two weeks your dad came home every month
do you think there's a time an amount where you could be away too long no
not really i mean it's hard to quantify in a very very specific quantifiable way right it's
hard to quantify but the point is if you make a large enough impact you could see your i if i had a son i could see him
once a year but my son should want to emulate me you should want to be me he is me so i have
to live a lifestyle which is worth emulating this is the difference between kings and peasants and this is the problem with the world today
99 of the men including 99 percent of men are going to watch this interview all the crypto dorks all these dudes all
these losers they're peasants they have a peasant mindset when a king had a son he wasn't staying
at home changing diapers he was conquering new lands and going to battle for the name for the bloodline to set an
example for his son to graze into right dad's out here he's conquered this he's built this castle he's out there he
slayed those people killed those people i'm the next i gotta go do something that's how a king raises a son by
example a peasant raises his son the same way a female raises his son
the [ __ ] is this apparent that's not being a dad it's it's it's not being a dad this is all new age garbage and it's
the femme centric mindset which is controlling men to the point where they can't be honest amongst themselves and
i'll tell you another thing and this is a study that's been done the higher your testosterone level the lat the lower your natural interest in
babies this is an actual i can't imagine that yeah and what happens is when a man sits around a baby all the time his
testosterone level naturally decreases because it makes us more tolerant of the screaming of the crying woman's moaning
it's hard to be around all that crap when your testosterone levels high right so especially as a man if you decide to
be a second mother to some degree you're chemically castrating yourself you're losing your superpowers anyway
if you have a high testosterone level you should want to see your children you should love your children you should protect your children i'm not saying you shouldn't love them i'm saying you
should pick them up have fun with them wow love you so much been two hours i'm out see you that's how a father raises
kids he doesn't sit there all day every day that's new age garbage it's not real
but given what women want out of a relationship women don't know what they want ah here we go they don't women want
things that the women think they want things and then they get them and they leave the dude women women don't have a clue what they want i want a guy who's
sweet and sensitive and takes care of my knees and thinks about me but they're all out there none of you are
with them why because women don't want that women don't actually want that women want to be with a man they respect
women are only going to enjoy the time with and end up feeling in love with a man they
genuinely respect and unfortunately to be respected some of the qualities are detrimental to
the overall relationships let's say happiness i know loads of women who are with a dude they hate but they respect
him like he makes me so mad but he is the g and they stay with him as opposed to the
woman who's like well he's so nice to me but you know and leaves so women need to respect you as a man how's the woman
going to respect you as a man if no other girl wants you how's the woman going to respect you of a man if you're putting her above all your boys how's
the woman going to respect you as a man of an eye on the streets making money how's the woman respect you as a man if you don't respect yourself or other men
don't respect you respect is linked to fear how is a woman respect you as a man if people don't fear you there's a
problem with all these dudes out here all these dorks man especially in the crypto world i'm saying crypto because you're a crypto girl right these nerds
will make a little bit of money and wonder why their chick still leaves them because you're just a rich nerd now you're you're still a dork
you can still raise your voice and nobody give a [ __ ] i'll still run up on you and take everything you got
like you have to be a man worth respecting and that's extremely difficult to do and if you're going to
do all those things it's very very hard to become a man worth respecting sitting at home changing diapers and even if you
just make money on your laptop it's not enough what is it so what is enough so other than other than um you know not changing
diapers um and you know just setting around the world what is enough you talk about being tall muscular you can shoot
guns all this stuff you talk about right yeah some people aren't tools yeah so what would you do if you wanted to all
right so firstly firstly let's accept something god has favorites does he he certainly does okay and i'm
one of them as are you my dude look at your nice beautiful smile thank you he gave it to you god gave it to you right
so god does have favorites but it's not even about that for the longest period of human time for a man to be respected
for him to even be admired by society on any level to some degree he had to be a warrior that's what men did we fought
right so what then did we fall so if you're out here as a man and you have no battle in your life no conquest in your life no form of war in your life
then what you do and it doesn't have to be physical physical is the best example of it every woman wants a boxer or a
cage fighter of course you do biologically yes because it means that like if you know for me everything is
evolution right completely so it means that if you know one day the government's coming which they're coming
yeah um you know you want to know that he can physically protect you and the family right exactly so every woman
wants a boxer or a cage fighter but this is a testament to the problem of the modern world right right every single
man watching this knows that women wants fires every single man watching this would love to be able to say he's a
fighter but 99 of the men watching this will not go fight because they are afraid
they're all cowards they'll make up every excuse under the sun oh it's busy with my bitcoin oh dude
you're all a bunch of [ __ ] they are [ __ ] all of them that's all they are they're [ __ ] and and women can smell that so if you
want if you want to have a woman who truly respects you you need to put yourself through war in some form now what most men do is they avoid physical
confrontation because they're cowards and they start doing fiscal confrontation this is why men are so obsessed with money because it's a
degree of conquest we can no longer walk the earth and conquer land right it's not like we the olden days we could just
walk around as the romans just chop somebody up and take their land so now we conquer the land
financially this is why men will work so hard to be a ceo and give up his whole life just to be a ceo because then he
gets to feel like he's conquering something men have that innate desire for conquest so that's the second best thing i guess is to get rich i mean it's
not a bad thing to be rich certainly not but if someone were to say to me look you have to build the archetype of an
individual you have to build a man from the ground up and he has to be respected by both men and women he'd be a dude getting in the cage kicking the [ __ ] out
of people and every man knows this and every man can do it but they're all just [ __ ] we suffer from
modern society and all of its problems suffers from the fact that we are plagued by monumental cowardice amongst
the male population all men are cowards they're cowards it's it's literally mind-blowing to me the
level of cowardice we're forced to endure everyone's a [ __ ] everybody that why because it's been if they've
been deliberately designed to be [ __ ] the femme centric systems has deliberately installed frames in their
mind centric systems every single system is femme centric that's quite interesting because there's obviously
the idea that we have this patriarchy which i don't believe in but now you're literally saying it's the complete opposite oh it's absolutely we have a patreon
oh completely name of name a system which doesn't favor the female every court of law the justice system the the
legal systems it's all favorites assist all favors are female even even men we biologically are designed to
favor the female i'm telling you if you're a police officer and you turn up and a woman's crying you instantly to a degree thinking this guy might be
there's a degree of guilt because we are designed to protect females that's how we feel right so all the systems are fem-centric and the culture is
fem-centric everything we just talked about a man how he's supposed to raise a kid that's going to be mind-blowing to
some people and they're going to think this guy's crazy i should be at home changing diapers
pro you're supposed to be a warrior you're supposed to be a warrior you're at home changing diapers um okay so
there's this meme which is um bear with me what is it like good was it like strong men create um
what does it strong men create good times good times good times great weak men weak men create bad times and so on
and are the strongest men of history were they at home changing diapers did their wife tell them they weren't allowed out
because we have a kid and i need help or was he out there getting [ __ ] done and this is the point so a lot of things i
say people may disagree with them people may say i don't like the idea of that even some women may sit there and go oh that's wrong there's a whole bunch of
males we're going to try and pretend it's not true but it's the absolute reality of earth it's the absolute reality of earth
it's the truth right and it's very very hard to be a man worthy of respect if you're going to stick to these centric
systems we're suffering from monumental cowardice in every level the entire male population from the complete bottom to
the absolute top is corrupted by cowardice let's talk about um something you mentioned earlier um the scam sure you
guys know what we're talking about i don't want to raise any red flags here protecting the the good old algorithm so
you have some interesting views on that you as soon as um everything started and everything was uh shutting down yeah
picking my words very carefully yeah you started running basically you and your brother correct so i hold the record and
i will state this here publicly i am sure i hold the record for the the quickest reaction to the lockdown
because a lot of people now who understand that the things we were told they were not necessarily true it took
them a while what is not true about what's going on right now can you be more specific
the the danger factor the number of people who are affected by it the
reactions that we take and how they should have a positive effect everything it's all a sign up
every single level of of the entire i'm trying to be careful of my words every single level of the entire environment
is corrupted because we live in a world now where everything is corrupted i was saying this to someone the other day
there is nothing fair or just about the world anymore every single system from
the police to the judges to the governments the tax even the world health organization even the doctors all
of it is corrupt head to toe all of it is corrupted all of it so the whole thing is a scam and i
like to think i hold the records at the very very very beginning of lockdowns all the people now who are
anti-mask and anti-lockdown they all complied they all cut down and got scared ooh the cold and me and my
brother we put on twitter you have to time stamp within three seconds of this garbage we're on planes flying to sweden and belarus because the last countries
without lockdown and that's basically because we took the brave choice my brother and i sat there and had a conversation we said
this virus might be the real deal we might get really sick oh you you actually thought for a moment well back then it was when the people were
dropping dead on tv the italian hospitals fall it looks like a real deal right stuff was coming out of china it looks crazy yeah okay so how do you know
what to do but me and my my brother concluded well we don't know what to do so let's take the bravest possible
choice because you can't hide from a disease it's going to be here forever it's going to get us eventually so let's make the bravest choice let's die like
men let's charge it to gunfire because we're not cowards it turns out we went to sweden for two months in a wide open
country parking non-stop while everyone else was locked in their houses and we realized oh everything's fine
now if every other man did that exact same thing we wouldn't be where we are two years later the reason we are
suffering because we are suffering suffering the way we are suffering is because of the monumental cowardice of man
revolutions are nothing more than men standing in one place and complaining i'm screaming can't even get men to do that anymore
too busy they're too busy they're at home with the kids oh my wife said that's my dirty dirt day to babysit it's
more it's peppa pig more than that no no it's so much more that's fun you say peppa pig actually because boris johnson was talking about
peppa pig the other day listen no but but other than children staying at home
with the family all of you how do we stop what is all of it leo my dear it's
all of it this is what i'm trying to say you you we just started this interview and you said it's unusual that i say a
man should have more than one female right to you not unusual i just well it is unusual i just don't necessarily it's
not what i'm looking for so for me i'm just like i'm heartbroken that's okay
but no but the point i'm making is everything translates right it's a spider's web if you're gonna find a man
who's truly warrior minded who's truly conquest minded who's truly hard to govern
is he gonna get one chick and let her tell him what to do with his life no he's going to be that guy who does whatever he wants
and and this is where we also tie into loyalty because loyalty is a completely misunderstood concept
you value loyalty oh absolutely but male loyalty masculine loyalty is completely misunderstood
all these dudes out here who are at home with their wife thinking they're loyal you're not loyal loyalty is having
options and returning to the same place not only having one option they're very different things if i walk into the store and they only sell apples and i
buy an apple i'm not loyal to apples i don't have a choice loyalty is walking in the store where they sell all the
fruit i buy apples six days a week occasionally i get a big fat pineapple
and i go back to apples the day after that's loyalty without choice there's no loyalty so most these dudes and most
women who say he's loyal he's loyal he's lame and he can't get nothing else that's not loyal loyal is a dude who has
all those options and still is in love with you that's what loyalty is so masculine loyalty is completely misconstrued and misunderstood anyway
the truth is about most these dudes who talk about being loyal they couldn't get something else that their life depended on it nobody wants it
so i when i talk about a man having multiple women i'm not even saying he's gonna be a disloyal man i believe i know a lot of men who don't talk about me i
have some friends who are some russian guys they're multi-millionaires they have a wife she's beautiful she's been a
bentley she's living the good life when do you think when the russian mafia are out to play he has no chicks
do you think he ain't running around a bunch of barbie dolls no of course he is but he goes home to his wife and his
wife's like he can do what he wants i don't care about them i have to family i have the kids and she's smart and he's
smart and it's a happy environment only here in the west are you going to try and find a mafia boss and say you're not allowed to do that come on he's a g he's
a genie i understand it but from my just for me personally i just don't think
that's something that i could yeah you're living you're living in a fairy tale my dear because you that means you have to compromise no problem with it
because most these chicks out here and most these dudes out here do compromise everyone watching this compromises i say
this all the time if you were rich when you met the partner you're currently with you wouldn't even be with them you think you love your wife no you don't
because if you're a multi-millionaire you wouldn't even go with that [ __ ] so everyone to some degree compromises if you're saying that i value sexual
exclusivity above everything else that's fine but you're gonna have to compromise if i want if i want the most reliable
car i can buy i can't go into the ferrari garage and say it has to be reliable go buy a toyota then this is
what comes with the ferrari you get the performance you get the beauty sometimes it breaks down that's how it goes that's what comes with a ferrari if you want a
top top top tier man he's gonna do certain things and most women intrinsically know this if you go
to one of these parties in miami and one of these chicks is chilling with chris brown do you think she believes he's
going to be loyal no doesn't matter it's chris brown yeah i don't touch chris brown it was just an example my point is women
intrinsically understand a certain value of male that they're not going to get sexual exclusivity and they don't care
they only try and get that crap from beta males it's only a beta male they try and okay well you're not allowed nothing out there that when you're
really really john and i agree with you to a very large extent however i still want to
preview wrong one day you're not listening
the biggest bad boy you can find who is loyal to you which is fine but the fact that he is
sexually exclusive to you means that for some reason we don't know why yet there is a human metric in which he does not
excel in every form so you can go out there and like i said toyotas are really reliable ferraris are unreliable you
might go out there get yourself a nice bmw that's sure that's fine i'm not saying he doesn't exist you know yourself bmw i don't like bmw's well
that's but when the ferrari pulls up next door when i meet your dude i'll be like yeah
he's all right but how much less than a hundred mil nah come on whoa he's a broker i'll i'll bring you
wrong i'll pre-empt maybe he'll have money but he'll lack somewhere else so this is my point is that the the the
true masculine and true in the realm of true masculine excellence one of the benefits of such is sexual exclusivity
because females you have you have so many choices most men out here have no choice and the
very few men who are at the peak of the human experience of a man have all the choice and to find a man who has all the
choice which is extremely rare amongst males like less than one percent and say you're going to be with me and me only
it's hard it's hard why would he do that why would he do that i'll prove you wrong i'd love to prove
you wrong and look it's on the cards we'll talk about this and we'll see how i hope you have a happy marriage i'm not saying you're not
going to find a nice guy i'm not saying you won't find a guy who won't be loyal to you i'm not saying any of that i'm saying that that's compromise i
understand we'll see this compromise we'll see whether we've compromised it's compromise i want to go back to talking about the the lockdowns and everything
like that right because it's getting absolutely crazy um there are a lot of um people hate when i say this but
i believe it so i'm going to say it there are a lot of um resemblances with 1940s in terms of us
and them and um you know creating a second-class system of people so how do
we get out of this because all tyranny does eventually come to an end does it well we see it happens again history
doesn't repeat but it rhymes that's the best thing that i've heard recently i think it's amazing um but how do we then
come out of it i'm not saying in a hundred years we're not gonna go back into it but i'll be dead yeah you'll be dead
what do we do my boy will be on the streets don't worry so i mean that's why i have to raise him right because you're the next warrior do you have a boy no
but i'm gonna make about 20. so don't worry about it so um yeah it's a difficult question to be the
pessimist in me kind of thinks that this is different than all the other tyranny they've tried to enact before because
they have a technological advantage and they're getting to the point where they might be able to ensure via technology
that they can keep a degree of tyranny existing i really pardon me not scared but part of me is
pessimistic in regards to the fact that they have the tools now to put things in place which are going to be extremely difficult to break they're going to put
paradigms in place they're going to be extremely difficult to break i've lost all faith in humanity i didn't have much
before this and now i've lost it all like really genuinely and the biggest mental shift for me has been
before all this crap it was the blm riots and trump and all this stuff and everyone was screaming all cops are bad
and i'm like no come on we need the police you know law enforcement i'm going to change sides all cops are bad
why are you enforcing this crap it's insane the police are the police are they out here the ones actually
cracking skulls it's amazing that a very few elite can tell another select group
of the slaves to go and enact tyranny upon the other group of the slaves and they're gonna obey like this could all
end overnight if the police would wake up and say no that's not fair but they won't do it so all cops are bad so i've lost faith in the law enforcement
systems i've lost faith in the judicial system i've lost faith in governments to the point where i sold all my real estate did you yeah i refuse to even
hold real estate under a government i hate them so much every single one of them i can't stand any of them they're
all corrupt from head to toe you think you own a house oh you own that house right go piss off the irs tell me how
long you're in the house some cops are going to turn up with a piece of paper and you're out you don't own anything the whole thing's
a scam the whole system is a scam and you're talking about how it's going to end i don't know i don't know how it's going
to end my my answer to all of this is the organization that i control and run the war room
or what we do in our organization is we try very very hard we prepare people to be
adaptable so in regards to their finances in regards to getting multiple passports that kind of thing because darwin said
it it's not the strongest that survives it's the most adaptable this device we're here in miami right now right if
miami locks down i'll bounce i'm that guy i can i can live anywhere i can go to tokyo tomorrow for the rest of my life so i think the smartest thing
you can do in the current times is try and prepare yourself or try and construct a life which allows you to be adaptable because nobody knows what's
coming next i don't know what's coming next and nobody knows where to be it's very very hard to be proactive in such a chaotic environment you need to be
reactive and that's what the war room's all about so i'm trying to save myself and my people
that's the first thing i'm trying to do i'm not really trying to save the world no because a lot of these people out here they deserve the slavery
you deserve it listen at the beginning of this crap when i saw all the masculine influencers on twitter
the whole manosphere everything when i saw them all all be [ __ ] all everyone
you all deserve slavery oh now you've changed your mind now you're anti-mass you think i forgot i look stupid
elephants never forget right and it's easy to be brave now the sentiment has changed that's not being brave that's
just going with the flow the bravery was required at the beginning when me and my brother were getting arrested in germany
for refusing to wear masks you were at home tweeting pro mask all these losers all of them all the conservative all the
right wing all the masculine you were all cowards all of you and you all deserve the slavery which is gonna be bestowed upon you if i if i had tweeted
something pro-mass i would be issuing a public apology each week i am sorry for the
i'm sorry for the fact that i aided in the enslavement of man by believing the propaganda machine i apologize i was
part of the problem these guys aren't even sorry they're just gonna sit there and start now changing it and tweeting any mask and thinking that nobody
notices you're the reason we [ __ ] got here i lost respect for so many people so many people actually respected also
respect for all of them no warrior blood cowards how you gonna roll next to me be my boy if you're going to fall for
propaganda program how are you going to go to water are you going to go to war how are we going to set a police interview if you fall for propaganda
programming you listen police can arrest me today if they come in and say your brother said this i'm like no he did not shut up but
would you with you [ __ ] i might be thinking maybe he was pro mask last week
all you men are cowards most of the people out here deserve the slavery and i really do think that there's going to be a social split
even worse than before in regards to the rich and the poor what's gonna happen is you have people who have absolute
freedom and people who have complete i think it's gonna be polarized it's gonna get worse than ever have nots and have yachts and i'm on the right side of the
equation so worst case i'll be in my jet do my thing so worst case i know i'm okay and i just have a duty to protect
the bloodline but man i don't want to be pessimistic or nothing but when the rally call came
at the beginning of the battle i stood there by myself i stood me and tristan understand they're like where is everybody else and
you you can i don't need to name names anyone who's on twitter every single mascot account you can think of all the big strong men the red pill alpha all
the conservatives that are all cowards all of them you can go through their accounts to see all of
them [ __ ] out [ __ ] all of them it's crazy that's how we got it what can i do i'm just one man leia i know i have
these superhuman powers i know i look like that guy but i even i have limits to my abilities baby there's only so much i can do i think you're totally
right what we're gonna see is um like the the middle class just gone right completely it's going to be the
absolute freedom have nots and have yours have nuts and have yours there you go i want to be part of the have yours
that's the goal you are you will be you will be don't worry so you so you spoke about um
getting rid of all your real estate yeah um and i understand that and i really understand the um the pessimism you have
and the um like the deep hatred towards this system i i understand it you said something
really funny actually um a few years ago yeah you said to me um when you had nothing and you were living in america
they couldn't help you but as soon as you left the irs knew how to get ahold of you they knew how to call you oh yeah
they know how to find your ass when you owe them money yeah but it's never the you know like if they owe you money it takes months and months and months to
turn up if ever right but if you owe them money it's a whoo we better pay us the whole thing's a scam it's like the
entire financial system which we can discuss at length our entire financial system is designed to steal wealth from
the poor and just turn it into numbers on the screen of three destruction by design yeah oh yeah the whole thing is corrupt and when you understand the
system you understand that the system is rigged to a point where most people do not stand a chance to ever ever win so let's talk about this in what way is it
rigged it's rigged because and i we can go down the economics of it all yeah but my but my my very basic
premise of it is is that there's a whole bunch of people out here who are effectively slaves and when you're you're a slave if you have a job in any
form effectively some slaves are better paid than others but most people are slaves in the days of slavery what would
happen is the slave masters would use control and aggression and influence to convince you to do work for free so what
they could do is it could get work out of you with something that they can generate from the sky right they can be aggressive from the sky influence from
the sky a couple bullets are cheap whatever it took and they could get your labor now we have the exact same thing
but they just use fiat they use fiat money if the people in charge of the world can print unlimited amounts of
said thing and you'll give up your life for certain amounts of said thing then they own you they control you oh you
need a hundred dollars to do this print off you go slave it doesn't matter it's not real so who cares so the entire
world's a slavery system to some degree maybe you can make enough of those dollars and buy your freedom as i have right but in general
it's a slave system and anyone who's out here who still believes because it seems to be there are some people who still
believe in like saving up and save my money and if i'm really diligent and i get a mortgage in 28 years i might own
the pro man it's a trap all of it is a trap have you ever met a rich person asked
them why that how they got rich and they said saving no no this is the biggest thing
complete lie and everything they teach you about financial literacy is a lie everything they teach you about wealth creation is a lie everything they teach
you about what you're supposed to do with your money and how you're supposed to think of the lie they get your ass in dead at the very very beginning so how did you realize all this how did you
realize all this god has his favorites no how did you realize god has his favorite god can
instill potential into an individual but doesn't mean that individual is going to fulfill that potential something in the
environment has to happen i operate with divine purpose absolutely not so how so how did you realize all this i just you
know i i've always my entire life so i was my father was a chess grandmaster i was a chess player so at the age of
five i was indiana state chess champion and when i was eight i was on my way to becoming a fatty master so i was one of those child chess geniuses i never
actually ended up becoming a chess master because we moved to england my father said in america blah blah blah but
i've always been good at pre pretty good at analyzing the chessboard and even from a very very young age i just
understood and i don't know exactly where i got it from i understood the world is a scam all of it i was walking
to school one day walking to college sixth form with my four friends in a ferrari went past i was like yeah i was
like bro how do we get one of them it's like oh don't know what do you mean dunno doesn't it bother you he has 400
grand for a car doesn't that anger you that he has 400 g's for a car and our parents are broke or on a council estate
they're like well gus that's the average man like the average man has no fire inside of him i'm 16. i
couldn't sleep for three days because i saw a rari i want a rari i want one yeah now i have four right so
this is eight only four but i have 22 cars as a whole how many twenty two only twenty two i'm
sorry i'm sorry i don't want that every year i hope you meet a rich man but um but this is the exact point right
so i always had the fire inside of me and what happened is growing up in luton especially all the asian boys who are
driving these fast cars when you go to a petrol station three in the morning and a lambo and a rarity pull up you know they're dealing drugs yeah you don't
look at them and go ah he worked hard in school no way no exactly so you know so i always had
an intrinsic understanding that the the only way to truly get rich is to break the system in some degree so when i was
going to school and the school was trying to support the system they're trying to uh convince me that the system is the
best way to have a successful life i'll sitting there going but everyone's living the life i want
broke the system i don't believe in any of this the final straw for me is i actually did very very good in my a-levels i was supposed to go to
university i got an a in business after only three of the five tests because i
aced every single one i did this advanced test this distinction got distinction and i was offered uh free university in
the uk and asked ask off for business it was free so cool i got to go you need for free
i'm such a clever [ __ ] good so um but then they asked me to do a personal statement oh i hated that yeah
so i'm like personal statement you already said yes to me for free and who's going to read this hi my name's andrew i like to kick bugs who cares
like you've already said yes to me so it's during two of her class i'm arguing my two are saying why don't you need to do a personal statement they already said the yes to me then she's like
everyone has to do one i said no one's gonna read this junk so everyone has to do one i said you know what i won't go
then that's how stubborn i was my mom went crazy you threw away free university
over a personal so you could just wrote one you could have done it listen i'm gonna be a kickboxing champion don't worry about it right so
when stuff doesn't make sense and you're doing things for no reason but there was a reason the reason to me was that
there's a personal statement doing a past attempt doesn't make sense of course right and and i saw that as a genuine infringement that was oppression
i can't accept that no no i don't i know i'm smart enough and i'm stubborn and i've always been stubborn i'm like no
i'll be fine without your university without your personal statement goodbye i must be the only person to ever throw away from university in the uk but i
didn't go best thing that ever happened to me was not going to university thank god i was a four year head start
everyone's out here in uni i was making money i started off with a really basic boring job i was carrying boxes of ice
in a fish market you know i wasn't doing anything elaborate but at least i was working this i was getting up at five in
the morning running to work working all day running to the fight gym fighting all night running home this is why i
respect this i didn't have a car yeah my family didn't have a car right they was literally just run i used to run nine
miles a day to get places i had to get places i just run so like i couldn't wear nice clothes because i get sweaty right so i was this
guy for a track suit a t-shirt take my t-shirt off i didn't sweat too much or just run everywhere around losing you
just see me the crazy guy just running i really want people if you don't know luton please look up luton it was bad yeah i grew up in a bad place
but um what did you do though you you the you went to the fish fish market fish market you while kickboxing correct
and then what did you do right so i wonder how you made money you wanna know the whole story of how i got rich yeah it's a really long story every time but
yeah but i i've always said the point is i've always had that fire inside of me i've always had that desire inside of me i think every man is born with a
masculine fire i think it's certainly the reason why so many things in history happen it's the reason why so many
armies try to conquer the land that look like why why would the romans wake up and look in a random direction and say
let's go over there whoever's there is kill him that's inside of men there's something masculine about conquest right
that fire has been dampened it's been dampened by distraction and consumption and all these things but for me i think
the fact that i was so broke i couldn't really distract myself i couldn't consume anything i couldn't buy anything like so what do you do it was either a
life of crime or a life of punching people in the face and getting paid for it so i chose to get paid and um
yeah the original question is why i resisted the system i just i could feel all these little triggers my whole life
of the system trying to oppress me and every single person i saw living the life i was aspiring to was outside of
the system even now to me now i consider myself outside the system i'm outside the matrix i can say what i want you to
get me fired who are you gonna do uh you're gonna go go get me fired anyone who's triggered by this get me fired
good luck yeah but you know like i love living outside the system i always aspired for it so that's the simple
answer i i i really think that and be careful i say on youtube yeah i don't want to get us taken down
demonetization i think you're working on youtube but any man out here with any kind of money
you have my network which is the war room which is the primary network in the world and besides us i don't think there's anything else but you need to be
very very understanding of the fact that if you're going to stay inside the matrix and be a fully law-abiding citizen for the next 10 years you'll get
crushed yeah you're going to get crushed you need to either get another residency to another country you need to get political connections i'm telling you
everyone saw my twitter during these lockdowns i traveled to 30 countries during lockdowns partied i partnered
yeah so all cause i knew somebody i know somebody everywhere i had a guy in russia who gave me a business visa
through his company to go to russia during closed call i know everybody right so with my connections my network and the number of passports i have which
is in excess of 10. i can do whatever i want on those passports how does it how does it work okay so like is your actual
name on it this is youtube my dear i want to know how it works this is youtube can you tell me keep telling me to tell me and
tell
okay so i'm not plugging my organization but one of the first things we do in the war room is we have a we have a specific section and a construct that helps
people obtain multiple residencies okay because and the reason that's so important is because if you only have
one passport then one government has jurisdiction over your life correct and i don't trust any of these governments now the idea of living off-grid is
outdated the idea you're gonna go to some hot in the forest and sit there with a bunch of guns and that it's not real right the new world orders here
we're all plugged into the system the best thing you can do as opposed to living off-grid is to live on as many grids as possible because that allows
you that allows you a lot more flexibility in the height of toronto when i was traveling around when i wanted to go into a country and said you're not allowed in the country
americans are banned english people are banned swedish people are banned ah romanians are allowed in yeah cool so i'm the same guy right i'm just whipping
out passports wait but is your name the same on all the passports i've really wanted to know that anyway the point is
the war room is the war room the organization i run coppertape.com that's something we specifically help with and
it's very easy to do there's ancestral routes yeah there's a whole bunch of roots it's not hard it's just a bunch of paperwork and headache but we have a
team we have lawyers with people who can help make all that happen so if you're a man and you have any kind of money you need to be
realizing that a degree of that money is worth spending on trying to obtain freedom and to obtain freedom you need to have as many passports as possible
okay so we'll talk about the passports after clearly got it okay i'll learn all about this afterwards so let's talk crypto um
you're very rude about um the crypto people uh you know okay am i rude i don't want to be rude
i don't want to be rude about crypto people yeah i like them i'm a crypto people yeah you're you're a crypto person yeah and and i'm not
i know a lot of crypto guys who are cool i have a lot of good friends i've made a load of money with crypto yeah i love a pump chain link right yeah i bought like
loads yeah i caught seoul at like six dollars yeah yeah so i i love i love crypto and
i love a crypto pump everybody does when i say detrimental things about the crypto community the point i'm trying to make is that
many people out here especially men are not prepared for wealth and when i say they're not prepared for wealth they haven't been through the struggle that's
going to allow them to become a man of caliber before they find money they haven't done the running to the fish stall running to the gym getting punched
in the face for money they've never done that so what happens when a 19 year old kid catches a crypto pump on some junk
like sheba now he's a millionaire fine but a few things have happened first his
ability to work hard has now been destroyed he will never work hard again right because look how much money he
made with blind luck do you think he's ever gonna go out there and get a job and take a pay of 50 grand a year and
really dedicates never even if he lost all that money the only thing he could ever think to do is to just try and get
another pump he's a gambler now he's effectively a gambler for the rest of his life so his his whole work ethic's
been decimated that's the first thing the second thing that happens when someone like him catches a crypto pump is because he has no life experience no
real-world experience no struggle etc he's now tristan calls them geese geeks geese
geese yeah like geese okay you for me geese and fermis is another word he made up but you just famished them they're
formicable he made it up i didn't know what that means you're a chick you know what it means no
matter how many times you say they don't like it says you turn up with your pretty smile okay oh oh i love you
it gets for me stickers gets taken out there's a game he gets for movies yeah wick like he has no caliber he's no
no character right he's got money but money is nothing more than an amplifier money doesn't change who you are and the
problem with most these crypto dorks is that they were dorks and now they're rich dorks but you're still a door yeah money is just an amplifier i'll
give an example lambo pulls up yeah nerd gets out now he's a super nerd oh some tech dork
he has a lambo who gives a [ __ ] to nerd lambo pulls up big man gets out now he's a mafia boss
so the point is that the lambo is not what makes you a mafia boss the lambo if you have all the other qualities will amplify your qualities into that sphere
it's an amplifier money is an amplifier and the point i'm making about wealth and crypto when i insult these guys that
a lot of these guys don't have any of the qualities they need to be amplified they don't have anything worth amplifying
if you're a man you've made a bunch of money on crypto the smartest thing you can possibly do is understand that the
traditional paths to wealth pre-crypto taught you a lot about being a man if i had to make millions the old-fashioned
way i'd have to learn to negotiate how to learn how to handle stress learn how to work really hard learn how to network
i'd have to learn i'd learn so many things these artists don't need to learn none of that just mask
they don't know anything so my point is that they've missed so many lessons on the path to wealth that wealth used to teach this is why women used to respect
money so much not just for the money but you knew you were talking to an ambitious connected smart intelligent man now you can meet a man of money and
he's none of them things he's literally none of them you just call crypto pump it's a unique atmosphere we're in it's
temporary but it's unique and when i say today when i saw the crypto guys like look you have millions and millions of dollars you need to get
some masculine accountability not to plug but the war room's exact kind of thing you need to
be in or you need to go down to a fight gym etcetera etcetera you need to learn all the lessons you missed on your path to wealth and that's why when i insult
crypto guys that's what i mean because i'll tell you something i've been to these crypto events blah blah blah i'm the only real g
okay okay maybe some of them have more hundreds of millions of dollars than me cool i'm the only one who ain't scared
i'm the one who'll throw down the street i'm the only one who if a gun came in the building would be looking to take your sailor now everyone else will be
running like girls you think money makes you something money doesn't make you anything especially not in the harsh reality of earth in the real harsh
realities of earth bravery makes you something not your money your mad mass ain't gonna save you some dude rolls up you the blade decides to stick in your
[ __ ] neck it's garbage so these men aren't men they're amplified dorks and now they're all over twitter with their
little nfts and their little cartoon faces together something i bought this nft you still don't matter g you still
don't matter because you want nft and and that's the whole problem with the crypto world is that none of them are actually very impressive people in
the re in real life and that's why i insult them but i don't want to insult them in a negative way i'm trying to inspire you guys look you
have the money now use that money to upgrade your character increase who you are as a man you know there's networks and things you
can join there's places you can go where you're gonna have to genuinely be held accountable and struggle and suffer and go through some trauma so you can walk
with some pride as opposed to looking like a complete geek there's no need for that you said
something interesting you said um when you're lifting weights in the gym that's your day off yeah it's my day off
because when i'm lifting weights in the gym that's a day off because i spent my entire career getting punched in the face i i i had 87 professional fights
and for the majority of those fights didn't even make any money it's a couple grand baby i was i was
flying around the world to fight some crazy kazak in armenia for like six seven g's coming out with my hand broken
my face busted up like i've been to hell and back and okay yeah it was self-inflicted but
genuinely genuine is one of the best things ever happened to me i thank the lord i spent my 20s engaged in constant
combat i don't know how there's a full-grown man out here if you're watching this how are you a full-grown
man past the age of 30 and you've never once had the balls once ever to get in
the cage in a fair fight against a worthy adversary and you walk the earth without shame i'd be ashamed as a man if i spent my
entire twenties the height of my masculine powers the height of my ability and never once did i have the
balls to go and meet somebody in fair combat ever once oh well i was busy busy doing what you spent so much time on
pornhub you're a liar never busy cowards all cowards and the crypto communities
man i'm telling you i go to some of these crypto things i look around just say you're all just so formulable i could i keto everybody in this [ __ ]
room no one could even stop me be a bloodbath it's a joke it's a joke what's the problem with pornhub
well i don't want to get into a side career i used to run it don't go down that path but the problem
with pornhub i'm not one of them anti-porn dudes i know that conservatives are whatever i
don't really care but like everything in life if it's consuming your mind and consuming your thoughts then you have an issue
and this is this is where we live in now there's a whole bunch of these crypto dudes especially who came and attracted female with all their money isn't that
crazy they have all the money in the world well you i think you said i think it was you that said something interesting however it was but it was
someone said it doesn't matter how much money a man has because women still fall in love with men that are broke
completely no no and also you know what the the biggest thing about money with girls is because people have this this
idea that money is going to help you get girls let me explain how money and girls works tell us i'll tell you
and i'll let you know if you're right i'm right baby let's go women love spontaneity
that's the first thing money facilitates women love fun money facilitates women love a man who's respected money
facilitates so money can help with certain of the things that women find attractive it's very rare unless she's a hooker or
a gold digger that women are very very interested in the actual number of how much money you have or spend but what
women don't want is you lacking the ability to be spontaneity and stuff to be spontaneous or lacking
the ability to be respected because you're broke or to feel like she has fomo she's missing out and doing certain things she can't go certain places that
her friends go because you're broke she doesn't want that right so it's not the money in and of itself that attracts her
it's the certain options that it gives you as a man that she can find more attractive i think that's the biggest thing about it but here's the thing
about money most people don't understand is that for the most beautiful women on earth the reason they don't really
respect your money is everybody they every guy they talk to has money hmm
you're never going to go on a a date with a broke dude so every single place you go you don't pay so do you actually
care how much money that guy really has or how much dinner really was not really it was just dinner so the point is that
money is not enough to get a beautiful woman it's enough to qualify you to try
because she ain't gonna go with a broke dude and she's gonna go with one of ten dudes she can go with and they all have
enough money maybe more one is more one is less but they all have enough money to give her the basic things she wants bit dinner a bit fun holiday blah blah
blah so it just qualifies you to try so if money is all you have and you have absolutely no other qualities you're going to lose to the dude who has money
and and the other stuff that's the game money is like having arms like a chick a chick's not gonna get
with you just for having big arms but if she can get with a dude she probably wants to do to have some arms it's one
of them it's like i'm gonna give you just for money but i don't know with a broke guy so like women don't really think about money that way they're just
like well every guy i go on a date with is rich and men lie especially rich men and there's a man with a million he'll
say he has 10. girl doesn't know you know i mean like it's very rare you someone like me with so much quantifiable wealth
but like i have a [ __ ] six million dollar car bugatti all this kind of thing so with me it's hard to lie right but there's a whole bunch of guys out
here who can catch a 400 grand pump and they can convince the girl he's a multi-millionaire for years i can't confirm there's a caterer in the
kitchen that blew my mind i walked into that i walked in to go to
the bathroom and then there's this guy just cooking and all this beautiful fruit and of course i've got to eat i
see it so i told you i'm a man of god i don't have a woman in my life who i eat if i hire a catering company but um
no but the point i'm making is that these dudes think if i get money i'll get chick no you won't because you'll get money and then the chick you're
after is still going to be dating athletes superstars all these dudes they have money too bro you think your board ape is going to impress her
there's a ton which is um you can do anything to a woman but you can't bore her that's absolutely true so funny no
but it's true and and to get a little bit dark it's true i knew a girl
in luton who was in an abusive relationship right her man was always hitting her screaming she was always crying i want to leave him blah blah
blah problem was when she finally left him in fact he got banged up for drugs so he went to jail
she got some other guy a nice guy and she was a complete prick to this dude and she was so unhappy and the problem
was it's very very hard to be interesting when your ex is a psycho the new guy is boring
it's true i can see in her eyes i'd say you're you're going home and you're you're turning up two hours late and he
ain't even screaming and you're bored aren't you well no no no i said you missed the days of the [ __ ] flying plates and [ __ ] because
it's because it's card women are addicted to drama you watch tv shows women watch serial killers documentaries
to relax like this is the reality of females you want drama you want excitement it's not
a bad thing you watch the kardashians you don't want it smooth i don't watch any of that stuff i'm just gonna put
that out okay but as a generalization of course leia is different i'm sorry but as a generalization
the point i'm making is that you're right sometimes women are attracted to very very toxic men because toxic men are not boring
you're never you're never bored with a nut case and and then after or not after a crazy guy you're trying to get with a
normal guy and you end up being very very bored so you're right you can do anything to a woman except for her a lot
of these dudes are out here treating women like complete [ __ ] but she's staying because she's not bored and it's boring everywhere else in comparison
so it's it's just it's certainly true as a paradigm it's true girls just want to have fun cindy lauper there you go you
said something interesting as well see i clearly follow everything i'm a fan like i respect the hustle fully high five
fully respect the hustle may not agree and then you know want to live the same kind of lifestyle but i respect it you
said something which was um when you wake up in the morning you don't ask yourself if you're happy oh completely not but what's funny about
that was a lot of your um a lot of that kind of like masculine um like self-help yeah um it's for men yeah but as a woman
i find that really helpful because you said because you said um women just want to be happy they just want to wake up
and feel happy yeah but you said no wake up and just what did you say wake up and
yeah so i created something where am i doing yeah so so the basic premise is that the paradigm of happiness is
completely misunderstood i believe that because people always say to me oh well you have all this money tape but are you happy let's see if i'm going to be like
no like i got i guess what they're hoping i'm going to do yeah i'm like bro i'm fine enjoy the bus no but the point is
the whole paradigm of happiness is largely misunderstood and we talk about happiness in society
as if it's the most important metric and i'd actually argue that it's not an important metric at all and it's also really truly amazing how
what you define in your mind the limits you set in your mind of what happy is and what happy isn't becomes very very
true so i watched a very interesting documentary once about colors colors colors yeah and it was a tribe in africa
that used different words to describe colors so to them blue and yellow are the same color same
word right and also these two very different shades of green and i'm talking about like grass and a leaf like
basically the same sheet of shade of green they're completely different colors so when they showed them blue and yellow and they said
can you tell the difference they're like no it's the same color i can't tell the difference between the blue and the
yellow but they couldn't see the difference they couldn't see it because in their in their mind it had one word
so because they grew up their whole life and it had one word that those two colors within that spectrum to them it's just like it's one color they couldn't
see the difference just like we'd say different various of pink it's all pink they couldn't really see the difference whereas the two very different shades of
green they're like oh yeah that's that that's that oh they're completely different so the point is their own mental blocks their own mental barriers
where they had mentally decided to put the breaks control their reality and people often talk about being happy
and what they do is they talk about being happy in the same way a child in their very giddyish christmas morning happiness you know like
i'm happy i'm happy that's never going to be long lasting that's going to be temporary if you were like that all the
time you wouldn't even get anything done right you wouldn't even be a mature adult so the idea that you're out here searching for that feeling permanently
is astonishing as immature that is certainly happy sure but i've changed
the paradigm of where happiness is for me anything above distraught is happy besides three or four
monumentally destructive events that are going to happen throughout my life that the loss of family member or something unless i really really feel down i'm
happy so if i wake up it's not i'm thinking if i'm happy or not if i'm not devastated i'm happy it's it's black or
white if it's not black it's white so even if i wake up and i'm furious and i'm stressed and i'm pissed off i've got much to do i'm still happy i've decided
i'm happy my happiness barrier isn't this little giddy-ish at the top my happiness is everything besides feeling distraught that's how i've designed it
in my mind so i describe myself as a happy person and i and i don't really put much merit on my feeling of the day
i've got things to do i'm an adult i get my [ __ ] done regardless of whether i'm super happy or slightly less happy i'm
still happy and i still perform and that's it as a whole so when i meet guys oh i want to be more happy i'm like bro that is a
stupid destructive way to try and live your life to constantly self-analyze and compare your happiness to how happy you
were at another period and how you're gonna get happy again trying to get to the top one percentile of happiness it's
it's stupid it's not real right do you understand where i'm coming from yeah i agree with you but i think what's funny is that a lot of this um kind of
advice is given to men and you'll say like a woman doesn't need it but i find a lot of value in this kind of advice
that's i prefer so they say that women give really bad advice right yeah they say they give terrible advice i don't
necessarily agree or disagree but i i seek out advice that men give to other men for myself good good because i think
that a lot of the advice that men give to other men is going to be harsher and more logical and less emotionally led
but but i say this all the time to guys who message me and saying they're not happy i say two things i say firstly you shouldn't be measuring or be concerned
with how happy you are shouldn't be something that's in your mind or something you're even thinking about right you've got other things to think about and other things to do that's the
first thing the second thing is [Music]
so the first thing the fact that you will sit there and self-analyze yourself to determine how happy you are out the
score of 100 is already a mental failure that's a failure you should be busy you shouldn't cross your mind the fact
you have time to sit there and go how happy am i today oh i'm only this much maybe i should be happier that's already
a mess up the second thing is and this is the truth most of you
in fact the large majority of you don't deserve to be happy why because they haven't done the work
it requires to be happy you're not a man of genuine excellence in every human metric you don't deserve to be happy
you're sitting at your computer with your board ape and your nfts and four million dollars but you're fat and
you're boring and you stick and you expect yourself to be happy you don't deserve to be happy you don't deserve it
you haven't worked for it beauty lies on top of the mountain my friends you have to climb it you have to get all the way
up there to see the peak and this amazing view let me tell you something i'm happy because all i've done is
suffer that's all i've ever done is suffer this is how i got here suffer my life's been nothing but suffering and
trauma that's how i got here that's why my that's what my world view is so brilliant that's how i can wake up and as long as no one has a gun to my head i
am happy because i have suffered you ladies and gentlemen haven't suffered
enough and if you haven't suffered you're never going to be happy happiness lies atop a mountain if it's just laying all over the floor and anyone can pick
it up it has no value people's entire mental model is skewed you look you're a crypto guy right you believe in nfts
nfts the whole point of them is that there's one it's the scarcity that provides the value if things are not scarce there's
no value to it yeah right so it doesn't matter what it is doesn't matter if it's financial doesn't matter it's even a good body right the fact that a guy has
big arms the reason that has value is because it's rare if every dude naturally had big arms by default it wouldn't have a value so you're talking
about happiness as it should just be laid all over the floor if everyone could pick up happiness without trying you still wouldn't be happy because it
wouldn't have value and you'd be aiming for a new you'd be looking for a new attention of happiness you're looking for something else you just raised the
paradigm and people who are out here trying to find happiness without trauma and suffering those are the guys who get addicted to drugs alcohol all this crap
because you're trying to find temporary happiness you're going to find happiness through pain that's where happiness comes from as a man and i'm not i know
you say you take some of my advice etcetera etcetera i love male advice yeah perfect but it's the struggle that
adds to value to things the reason i'm going to love my cars so much is because i had nothing and now i have one walk
nine miles i walk nine miles now i get to do it in a lambo it's beautiful if i was born into money and was just given a
lambo for my birthday i wouldn't even appreciate it that's the reality so most you men out here don't even deserve happiness you come to me talking about
happiness you don't deserve and you know you don't deserve it because you're coward and you're lazy and you're weak you don't deserve happiness it's good you're unhappy that's your own mind
telling you you need to do more because if you were genuinely genuinely making an impact on the world and exerting your
entire masculine force out into the universe if you were genuinely doing that you'd find happiness so if you're sitting there feeling depressed it's
because you know you're lazy you know you're not working very hard i don't want to rant on your podcast no it's good i'm enjoying it i'm enjoying it it
really it's just like the whole idea that a good doesn't exist without evil right so good doesn't exist without batman yang 100 bling and yang light and
dark we we don't want to feel what's the exact same we all love the sun we don't want to see the rain but you can't rain uh i've not
heard this i can't remember we all love the sun we don't want to feel any pain but you can't have a rainbow without a
little rain something like something something like that but no this is as old as human time right and the whole
people especially men if you have this paradigm in your mind that you should just be happy by default without trying without working without any kind of
struggle without any negatives in your life and you're just gonna be a happy person and you're always just gonna be laughing and giggling in the top one percent that's asinine it's not real
it's a stupid mentality to have i don't care how happy you are you have work to do if any man comes to me and he's
looking for guidance i say i don't i don't really care how happy you are because you're fat you got work to do come talk to me when
you have a six-pack otherwise i don't care you have too much to get done to be talking about happiness most you men out here have so much to get done before you
talk about happiness it's amazing to me how little work the majority of people out here are doing i like you're a
full-grown man living in a transitionary period of humanity where the entire
financial system is broken and trillions of dollars are created from the sky and you don't have a single million
you don't have one they're all they're everywhere like how do you be a full-grown man and not be a millionaire like are you dumb
how many millions are too many millions because when we met in london something that i haven't forgotten which i thought was hilarious was you and your brother
said to me look 20 million is good right i don't think you need more than 20 million in life if we have 22 million we have an
emergency meeting and we sit down and say how can we blow those two millions yeah completely so no i think twenty twenty we've raised the bar i thought it
was funny yeah 20 to 30 million is enough right anything above that i believe the money no longer has value
and it's better to spend on a human experience that's what i believe because if you have 30 million or 40 million
your life's not going to change if you have 30 million or 100 million your life's not going to change your life's the same so i'd rather splunk all that
money on human experience and amazing things and try to get the best out of the physical world we live in that's that's what i personally believe in so
that's enough to to survive but it also depends there's some people who are out here i see a lot of crypto guys and a
lot of other people they're talking about generational wealth i'm gonna save my bitcoin there they really want their children to be rich i don't want my kids
to be rich that's another mindset i have i really want to die taking most of my money with me i do not want rich children really absolutely i
agree with that but what do you i understand why it's obvious but in times of your money what would you do with it
you don't don't just give it i mean you just give it to some institutions some [ __ ] charities nothing like that so what i'm going to
do is i'm going to financially incentivize my children so yes they're going to have the ability to be so when
i used to have to run to the gym and suffer and fight and at the end of it i still didn't have food my boy is gonna
go through all that and he's gonna fight and then i'm gonna give him some money but still he has to suffer still he has to fight still he has to win still he
has to run to the gym and back et cetera et cetera the worst thing you can do for a child is racing bridge and and so
that's the worst thing you can possibly ever do so i have no interest in that whole general relational wealth crap but
yeah i find it i find it but if you want to build generational wealth you you just don't want them to have an easy life you want them to you don't want
them to suffer exactly how you did i want them to suffer i want them to suffer a lot a lot yeah but maybe maybe
in a slightly different way right but they're i'm going to make sure they go through a lot of pain because it what makes them mad it's what makes him a
character right it's extremely important but i find it i really find it remarkable when i meet
men who say they work hard and i'm not trying to be i'm not listening i'm not being elitist i'm not being a horrible guy here because i'm from the streets
right i'm from the ghetto i'm not talking about if you're a taxi driver or whatever you've been texting your whole life i'm not trying to sit here and [ __ ] on you i'm not trying to do that i'm
saying that especially if you're a younger man and you have you have access to the internet and you're paying attention to the things that are going on in the world and you do your studying
and you're not hard to do some work well uh if you're not afraid of work i find it amazing those guys out here are still broke
how can you be poor in the modern society that we live in like
there's money everywhere there is it's literally everywhere like so when i see a dude he's like oh yeah man i'm broke
i just look at him and go you're not trying hard you're not trying hard yeah you're simply not trying on it if i can do it from a single mother effectively
from a loot and council estate to to ultra high net worth individual then i i refuse to accept others can't
do it and people say oh yeah but you did this or you had this blah blah blah perhaps you know but i don't i don't
operate within that realm i'm not going to be softer on anyone else than i was on myself of course if i held myself to
such a crazy high standard and i was so accountable and so difficult and so hard on myself why am i going to be soft on
you i was extremely hard on myself i go sparring for four hours and i got hit once i was curious you want to be hit more no i don't want
to get hurt you don't get hit i don't get it okay i don't want to get touched right i got
hit once i couldn't i couldn't sleep for days i was absolutely a perfectionist right
and then there's dudes out here are just just sloppy right they're sloppy with their entire life they're just sloppy and they're like oh yeah well you know
just wear the mask and they deserve what's coming they deserve what's coming from slavery they're amateurs we live in we we're really living in a
paradigm shift where the professionals of life and when i say the professional explaining that means in a minute but the professionals of life are gonna
genuinely excel where all of you amateurs are gonna fail most people most men especially they live their life like
complete amateurs i don't understand how they even function they don't know their own passport number they haven't memorized men aside though like people
in general they're amateurs i sometimes i do wonder how people have gotten to certain ages and how they're even functioning getting offended by very
simple things i'm just like like how have you gotten to an age lived your whole life how on earth are you
functioning if that's going to upset you absolutely i don't understand how that even examines and that's how they stay inside the matrix right you need to
exert a degree of professionalism that's what i'm saying earlier about the crypto kids if you have money great fantastic you've ticked that off but there's a
whole bunch of other areas of professionalism you need to excel in you can give me any firearm on the planet right now i'm going to hit the target
you can give me any you give me any car in the world basically i'll run the cops like i'm that guy you need to become that guy you know it's practice you need
to go do it but these dudes just don't do it we're suffering from cowardice we talk about all the problems in the world it's easy to talk about them all but you
can narrow them all down to the exact same thing cowardice masculine cowardice all of it all of this is masculine cowardice
that's all it is and and man i see full grown men out here like wearing a mask you're scared of you're scared of air
you're scared of air probably the biggest dating filter there is i walk around miami oh he's got a mask
the medicine the medicine sorry sorry sorry sorry the medicine the medicine the medicine the medicine yeah but it's
it's incredible it really is incredible to me that that's the paradigm shift we live in and it's amazing to me that some
of the things i say are seen as so controversial because i don't think i see anything that controversial i'm saying look have some balls do what you
want to do stick to your your imperatives as a man try and get rich and try and try to some degree live with
a life of freedom that's all i'm trying to say see i really agree with you and i don't think anything's that controversial but before we started this
you said that you do piss some people off right no i don't really understand why i've got to be honest i actually
don't because i don't think anything you've said is unfair but but what i do is see i am i'm a sound board and what i
do is i annoy the majority of men because if you're gonna talk to me or listen to me or compare your life to
mine nearly any man on the planet is gonna to a degree be inferior so you need to humble yourself this is the
truth men need to humble themselves because like talking about crypto right yeah i'm all right especially
rich yeah but i'm also rich and i'm also tall and strong and smart and i can keep this [ __ ] out of you yeah and i've got all these and i've got political
connections and i'm living a life of freedom and like you're rich but you're afraid to go outside someone's gonna rob you so it's
very difficult for men to compare themselves to me and not to some degree take an l so they have to humble themselves so what happens when i talk
to people is either they go this is inspirational i want to learn from this guy he has so much to teach he's right i need to become a professional i need to
be well-rounded i need to join his network i need to know the people he knows i need to have all these assets and these these uh connections et cetera
et cetera or people go ah he's just so arrogant he's crazy and i'm sitting home with my wife and i raise my kids and
he's crazy but no i'm not crazy it's defense mate it's coke that's cool it's hardcode and
and lots of dudes have cope it's kind of amazing there's also something that's primal amongst men that women probably don't really know about but
as a man when you meet another man who you know can kick the [ __ ] out of you it bothers you even if they don't want
to admit it so even if i meet a dude and i'm really polite i'm like hey bro nice to meet you part of them is kind of like [ __ ] this
stuff oh no because they know i'll mess him up he knows i'll mess him up and it's something intrinsic about
masculinity it's kind of like when some girls hate girls who are prettier than them they're all girls but some girls like oh [ __ ] that but she speaks right
it's the same kind of thing but it's just violence related right so there's that aspect yeah it's ridiculous but it's primal and
you can try it and you can also tie into the fact that they don't like people who are richer than them right men are like people who richer than them they're survival yeah
yeah so so when they meet me and i'm more important than them richer than them i beat the [ __ ] out of them and then i take all these boxes they just sit and go all he's crazy i don't like
gaming i don't want him on my podcast blah blah blah i've had people record podcasts with me and refuse to put him
out what did you say the same [ __ ] i'm saying now the truth the truth but you weren't like more like
inappropriate or harsher or not written not really because i don't think you said anything too bad
look i don't think so i don't know maybe they're worried you go down i go down cause i just said i agree with everything you just said basically see
you in jail literally so i'll get us out i got phone calls i got phone calls don't worry about it yeah i'll get it so um okay what is the
final goal then because every day you're always like you know every day i'm hustling every time i'm survived you know you don't take a day and you do
take days off but it's not like a day off right yeah um like like we said earlier even lifting weights is your day off right right like for me lifting
mates is lifting weights it's not a day off so what's the final goal like where do you see yourself in like 20 years that's a
good that's a good question and i believe i have a duty to protect the bloodline i have a duty to my last name it was
instilled within me my father yeah tate my father's on the greatest man on the planet unfortunately is no longer with
us which now promotes me to the greatest man on the planet so i have about your brother you equally greatest men all
right yeah we should we share them so i have a lot of work to do and i think
that the duty i have to my bloodline it depends the exact path i'm gonna take
i don't know if i'm gonna have 20 sons with 20 women we're going to find one woman who might give me two or three et
cetera but i think the family is a beautiful thing but the nuclear family as it's told within this trad calm
conservative that's garbage if you were to ask me now to design my ideal life like if i could just design it i'd have
three or four sons in moscow three or four sons in kazakhstan maybe two or three sons in mongolia you know my three
chicks inshallah my three wives and uh they'd all be training hard becoming warriors of earth all carry the last
name tate and in the future as much as people go tate you can't do that you can't kids with all these women you can't do that blah blah blah in the
future when the dystopian when the machines arrive when the terminators turn up and you're like where's john
connor roast john connor oh he was an act of fiction but there is a man there is a man who does exist there's a man who's real he's from deep in mongolia
and his name is emery andrew tate the fifth and he's going to rise up because even i am human i know it's hard to
believe even i have human i'm human right and there's limits to my power time is in the fire in which we all burn
even i will get old but when i am old i need to make sure i've done my job because it would be a detriment it would
be unfair to humanity for me to not create clones of myself to protect the future so that's my plan my plan is to
protect the future via my offspring that's my plan okay plug whatever you're doing so the war
room yeah follow him on twitter he's also got a great um youtube where
you are very unfiltered um there's a hilarious thing about how why women should cook and men shouldn't cook which
by the way as somebody who's like running her own show i understand am i right because
opportunity costs completely but like again gender aside like i have like cooking you know opportunity costs the
amount of time i waste cooking it's insane the amount of business schools i could have fit in in that cooking period
completely completely i the youtube is that tape speech check it out but i i have a i say some things
that sound outlandish like if you're broke you should never cook you're like what are you talking about but it's opportunity cost you ain't got time to
waste i know bro i know broke dudes out here cooking breakfast cooking lunch cooking dinner you're wasting how many
hours no wonder you're broke like cooking should be a luxury for the ultra rich like either that or hire a chef
you've got stuff to do with your life you're out here broke as a joke sitting there with a frying pan you're like is
that you're gonna that's how you're unless you're planning to get rich these people have no no understanding of her no understanding of the world so yeah
cooking's a massive opportunity cost if you're a man out here and you cook meals and you're not a millionaire you're [ __ ] up you're [ __ ] up your life so
stop so take speeches to youtube at cobra tate is the instagram twitter

existed can't you tell leia that i'm far too intelligent yes yes yes i'm far too intelligent for the age 35 i've been
i've existed for 5 000 years i'm a reincarnation of do you actually believe you're incarnated
i don't know i should say yes or no so you say the truth it's not so much about believing belief has nothing to do with it it has nothing
to do with belief the the fact is that i am the last of the warrior class
and the my whatever occupies me whatever inspires me to act in the way i act
right you say this i don't have divine purpose i say divine purpose whatever it is it's ancient okay right
and for 5 000 years whatever fire is inside of my soul has wandered the
the the forests of udaan in battle against evil
the ninja shogunate you understand yeah okay so all right so there was a in
ancient times there was a ninja spirit which is engaging against the evil samurai and that is the the spirit which
is inside of me today so i descend from udon and and when i talk about the bloodline
it is my job to instill the same warrior spirit in my offspring i will not have sons who are too busy buying nfts and
saying oh i made a little bit of money and have skinny little arms and go to crypto conventions and be dorks i will not have nerds as children i refuse to
have a nerd carry the lame tape if my son is a nerd one of us has to die him or me and i'll challenge him to mortal

exaggeration but it sounds cool right that sounds good i understand it um andrew thank you so much for chatting
